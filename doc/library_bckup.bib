	abstract = {Autocorrelation is a very general statistical property of ecological variables observed across geographic space; it most common forms are patches and gradients. Spatial autocorrelation, which comes either from the physical forcing of environmental variables or from community processes, presents a problem for statistical testing because autocorrelated data violate the assumption of independence of most standard statistical procedures. The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is briefly discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models. Two approaches are proposed; in the raw-data approach, the spatial structure takes the form of a polynomial of the x and y geographic coordinates of the sampling stations; in the matrix approach, the spatial structure is introduced in the form of a geographic distance matrix among locations. These two approaches are compared in the concluding section. A table provides a list of computer programs available for spatial analysis.},

	abstract = {Wild juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) were individually marked in October 1990 and 1991 to evaluate the effects of habitat complexity and fish size on over-winter survival in Big Beef Creek, Washington. Habitat complexity was quantified for the habitat unit where the fish were collected and, in 1991, also for the 500-m reach downstream from the collection site. Survival, estimated from recovery of marked smelts at the stream's mouth, differed between years (25.4 and 46.2\%) and also varied among habitat units and reaches within years. Survival was at most weakly correlated with complexity of the habitat units but was strongly correlated with the quantity of woody debris and density of habitat units in the 500-m reach, and distance from the estuary. Because distance covaried with habitat complexity, we could not ascertain which factor had the primary influence on survival. In addition, larger fish generally survived at a higher rate than smaller individuals. However, fish tagged above William Symington Lake were smaller in the fall but larger as smelts and had higher survival rates than those tagged below the lake. Taken together, these results reveal complex relationships between size, habitat, and growth that may affect over-winter survival and subsequent life-history events.},

	abstract = {This study evaluates the sensitivity of Washington State's freshwater habitat of Pacific Salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to climate change. Our analysis focuses on summertime stream temperatures, seasonal low flows, and changes in peak and base flows because these physical factors are likely to be key pressure points for many of Washington's salmon populations. Weekly summertime water temperatures and extreme daily high and low streamflows are evaluated under multimodel composites for {A1B} and B1 greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Simulations predict rising water temperatures will thermally stress salmon throughout Washington's watersheds, becoming increasingly severe later in the twenty-first century. Streamflow simulations predict that basins strongly influenced by transient runoff (a mix of direct runoff from cool-season rainfall and springtime snowmelt) are most sensitive to climate change. By the 2080s, hydrologic simulations predict a complete loss of Washington's snowmelt dominant basins, and only about ten transient basins remaining in the north Cascades. Historically transient runoff watersheds will shift towards rainfall dominant behavior, undergoing more severe summer low flow periods and more frequent days with intense winter flooding. While cool-season stream temperature changes and impacts on salmon are not assessed in this study, it is possible that climate-induced warming in winter and spring will benefit parts of the freshwater life-cycle of some salmon populations enough to increase their reproductive success (or overall fitness). However, the combined effects of warming summertime stream temperatures and altered streamflows will likely reduce the reproductive success for many Washington salmon populations, with impacts varying for different life history-types and watershed-types. Diminishing streamflows and higher stream temperatures in summer will be stressful for stream-type salmon populations that have freshwater rearing periods in summer. Increased winter flooding in transient runoff watersheds will likely reduce the egg-to-fry survival rates for ocean-type and stream-type salmon.},

	abstract = {Stream restoration projects often aim to benefit aquatic biota and frequently use the reappearance of sensitive nongame fish species as a measure of restoration success. However, mitigation of human influence will only benefit a given species where static habitat characteristics are suitable for that species and where potential source populations are within the range of their dispersal capability. We used spatial autoregressive habitat models to simulate the effect of watershed-scale stream restoration on the distributions of six sediment-sensitive fish species in Wisconsin, {USA}, streams. These models consider the probability of occurrence of a species in a given stream segment as a function of characteristics of that segment as well as the characteristics of neighboring segments. Populations of individual species are predicted to be restorable in 0.2\%-2.8\% of Wisconsin streams. Streams with high restoration potential for one or more species generally have high watershed human land use but are also closely connected through the stream network to relatively undisturbed streams. These results indicate that habitat restoration for nongame stream fishes will be most effective when it builds onto existing suitable habitat because of both dispersal limitation and spatial autocorrelation of habitat characteristics.},

	abstract = {Twenty-five years of extensive water temperature data show regionally coherent warming to have occurred in Alpine rivers and streams at all altitudes, reflecting changes in regional air temperature. Much of this warming occurred abruptly in 1987/1988. For brown trout populations, the warming resulted in an upward shift in thermal habitat that was accelerated by an increase in the incidence of temperature-dependent Proliferative Kidney Disease at the habitat's lower boundary. Because physical barriers restrict longitudinal migration in mountain regions, an upward habitat shift in effect implies habitat reduction, suggesting the likelihood of an overall population decrease. Extensive brown trout catch data documenting an altitudinally dependent decline indicate that such a climate-related population decrease has in fact occurred. Our analysis employs a quantitatively defined reference optimum temperature range for brown trout, based on the sinusoidal regression of seasonally varying field data.},

	abstract = {Although theoretical and empirical studies show that spatial heterogeneity has important effects on the dynamics of populations and the structure of communities, there has been little rigorous quantification of terms like ''patchiness'' or ''spatial heterogeneity'' in studies of lotic systems. In order to compare the spatial heterogeneity of different systems and understand the causes and consequences of that heterogeneity, we must first be able to quantitatively measure it. Spatial heterogeneity has many aspects that change with the scale of our observations, so we need a battery of descriptive measures that explicitly consider the scale-dependence of ecological pattern Response variables exhibiting similar frequency distributions (i.e., similar overall variability) can have very different spatial distributions; consequently, descriptions of spatial heterogeneity require spatial data, i.e., data related to geographic locations (maps). We review statistical techniques for quantitatively describing aspects of heterogeneity in spatial data, emphasizing the decomposition of heterogeneity into different scales of variation (trends, overall variability and spatial dependence or autocorrelation). Gradients in spatial data can be evaluated using trend analyses (e.g., regressions), whereas the spatial structure of variation around trends can be evaluated using geostatistical methods. The central concept of geostatistics is spatial dependence, which is the degree to which values of a response variable differ as a function of the distance (lag) between sampling locations. Semivariograms plot variation among samples separated by a common lag Versus lag, and can be objectively decomposed by piece-wise regression techniques to estimate the strength and scales of spatial dependence. A variety of other methods can be used to quantify spatial heterogeneity from categorical and numerical maps depending on the question of interest and the underlying structure of the spatial data (e.g., methods derived from fractal geometry and information theory, nearest neighbor analysis, spectral analysis, Mantel's test). Spatial heterogeneity in stream organisms is driven by local variation in environmental conditions, by interactions between individuals of the same or different species, and by the effects of organisms on their abiotic environment. By applying geostatistical methods to spatial data collected from field experiments, stream ecologists can evaluate the effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the spatial arrangement of organisms in streams. We present examples of data obtained from experiments examining how consumers affect, and respond to, spatial heterogeneity in their resources. The results indicate that consumer-resource feedbacks should be considered when modeling the causes and consequences of spatial heterogeneity in streams.},

The model used an export coefficient approach, calculating the total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) load delivered annually to a water body as the sum of the individual loads exported from each nutrient source in its catchment. The export coefficient modelling approach permits scaling up from plot-scale experiments to the catchment scale, allowing application of findings from field experimental studies at a suitable scale for catchment management. The catchment of the River Windrush, a tributary of the River Thames, {UK}, was selected as the initial study site. The Windrush model predicted nitrogen and phosphorus loading within 2\% of observed total nitrogen load and 0.5\% of observed total phosphorus load in 1989. The export coefficient modelling approach was then validated by application in a second research basin, the catchment of Slapton Ley, south Devon, which has markedly different catchment hydrology and land use. The Slapton model was calibrated within 2\% of observed total nitrogen load and 2.5\% of observed total phosphorus load in 1986. Both models proved sensitive to the impact of temporal changes in land use and management on water quality in both catchments, and were therefore used to evaluate the potential impact of proposed pollution control strategies on the nutrient loading delivered to the River Windrush and Slapton Ley.},

	abstract = {Agriculture has had a tremendous impact on soil nutrients around the world. In some regions, soil nutrients are depleted because of low initial soil fertility or excessive nutrient removals through intense land use relative to nutrient additions. In other regions, application of chemical fertilizers and manure has led to an accumulation of nutrients and subsequent water quality problems. Understanding the current level and spatial patterns of fertilizer and manure inputs would greatly improve the ability to identify areas that might be sensitive to aquatic eutrophication or to nutrient depletion. The authors calculated spatially explicit fertilizer inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) by fusing national-level statistics on fertilizer use with global maps of harvested area for 175 crops. They also calculated spatially explicit manure inputs of N and P by fusing global maps of animal density and international data on manure production and nutrient content. Significantly higher application rates were found for both fertilizers and manures in the Northern Hemisphere, with maxima centered on areas with intensive cropland and high densities of livestock. Furthermore, nutrient use is confined to a few major hot spots, with approximately 10\% of the treated land receiving over 50\% of the use of both fertilizers and manures. The authors' new spatial disaggregation of the rich International Fertilizer Industry Association ({IFA)} fertilizer-use dataset will provide new and interesting avenues to explore the impact of anthropogenic activity on ecosystems at the global scale and may also have implications for policies designed to improve soil quality or reduce nutrient runoff.},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. Ecologists have long been interested in the role of climate in shaping species' ranges, and in recent years, this relationship has taken on greater significance because of the need for accurate predictions of the effects of climate change on wildlife populations. Bioclimatic relationships, however, are potentially complicated by various environmental factors operating at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that climatic constraints on bird distributions are modified by species-specific responses to weather, urbanization and use of supplemental food. 2. Our analyses focused on 18 bird species with data from over 3000 sites across the north-eastern United States and adjacent Canadian provinces. We use hierarchal occupancy modelling to quantify the effects of short-term weather variation and surrounding urbanization on food stress and probabilities of detection, and how these fine-scale changes modify the role that climate has on the distributions of wintering bird populations at regional scales. 3. Examining site occupancy and supplemental food use across the study region, we found that average minimum temperature was an important factor limiting bird distributions, supporting the hypothesis that the occupancy of wintering birds is limited by climatic constraints. We found that 15 of 18 species (83\%) were more energetically stressed (had a higher likelihood of visiting a feeder station) as minimum temperature declined from the seasonal average. Because we found these patterns in populations that regularly visit supplemental food sites and were likely not food-limited, we suggest that resource availability is less important than climate in constraining wintering bird distributions. Across a winter season, local within-winter extinction probabilities were lower and colonization probabilities higher at warmer sites supporting the role of climate-mediated range shifts. Importantly, however, these relationships were modified by the degree of urbanization and species' abilities to persist in human-modified landscapes. 4. Our results suggest that urbanization and behavioural adaptation can modify the role of climate on bird ranges and should be included in future analyses of range shifts because of climate change.},

For the spring season, there is also evidence that mean temperature has increased. There are no apparent or obvious changes in stream flow to account for this. The strong relationship between air and stream temperatures (r2=0.96) implies that changes in the stream are the result of changes in the climate.

Watershed aspect influenced the response of trophic structure to grazing influences. Standing crops of rainbow trout were negatively correlated with solar radiation and maximum temperature in watersheds flowing northward. A different relationship was observed for a set of watersheds with a southern aspect, perhaps due to the presence of spring seeps and stream desiccation in the heavily grazed stream. Trout biomass was negatively correlated with solar radiation, whereas positive relationships were found for discharge and depth. Algal biomass was positively correlated with solar insolation (r = 0.91), total invertebrate biomass (r = 0.77), and herbivorous invertebrate biomass (r = 0.79) in all watersheds. Invertebrate biomass was not significantly correlated with rainbow trout standing crop. High irradiance apparently resulted in increased algal biomass and invertebrate abundance. However, temperature elevations to levels close to lethal may impose high metabolic costs on rainbow trout, which may offset higher food availability and affect the availability of prey.},

In particular, the hierarchical, dendritic structures of riverine networks are not well captured by existing spatial models. Here I use a simple. geometric model and metapopulation modeling to make three points concerning the ecological consequences of dendritic landscapes. First, connectivity patterns of-river-creek networks differ from linear landscapes, and these differences in connectivity can either enhance or reduce metapopulation persistence compared to linear systems, depending on the details of dispersal. Second, habitat fragmentation in dendritic landscapes has different (and arguably, more severe) consequences on fragment size than in either linear or two-dimensional systems, resulting in both smaller fragments and higher variance in fragment size. Third, dendritic landscapes can induce striking mismatches between the geometry of dispersal and the geometry of disturbance, and as is the case for arid-lands fishes, such mismatches can be important for population persistence.},

	abstract = {Like other regions of the northern hemisphere, the northeastern United States has experienced a general increase in regional temperatures over the past 20 years. Quantifying the ecological implications of these changing temperatures has been severely constrained by a lack of multispecies distributional data by which to compare long-term changes. We used the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas, a statewide survey of 5332 25 km(2) blocks surveyed in 1980-1985 and 2000-2005, to test several predictions that the birds of New York State are responding to climate change. Our objective was to use an information-theoretic approach to analyze changes in three geographic range characteristics, the center of occurrence, range boundaries, and states of occurrence to address several predictions that the birds of New York State are moving polewards and up in elevation. As expected, we found all bird species (n=129) included in this analysis showed an average northward range shift in their mean latitude of 3.58 km [Prob(H(a vertical bar)data)=0.87)]. Past studies have found that northern range boundaries are more likely to be influenced by climatic factors than southern range boundaries. Consequently, we predicted that northward shifts would be more evident in northern as opposed to southern range boundaries. We found, however, that the southern range boundaries of northerly birds moved northward by 11.4 km [n=43, Prob(H(a vertical bar)data)=0.92], but this pattern was less evident in northern range boundaries of southerly birds. In addition, we found that bird species demonstrated a general shift downhill in their mean elevation, but demonstrated little change in their elevational boundaries. The repeated pattern of a predicted northward shift in bird ranges in various geographic regions of the world provides compelling evidence that climate change is driving range shifts.},

Base flow availability varies over space and time in a region due to climate, topography, landscape, and geological characteristics. In this study, base flow index ({BFI)} (base flow/total stream flow) was estimated from daily streamflow records using a recursive digital filter method and interpolated to produce a raster grid map for the conterminous United States. When compared for validation, {BFI} estimated by recursive digital filter method showed good agreement overall with the {USGS} smoothed minima {BFI} method. Estimated base flow index and volume were analyzed, with Hydrological Landscape Regions ({HLRs)} developed for the United States to identify the mean hydrologic flow response within {HLR.} They were also used to determine relationships with hydro-geologic descriptive variables and used for defining the {HLRs} based on Pearson's correlation table and a stepwise multiple regression. These descriptive variables used in defining the {HLRs} include relief, effective rainfall, potential evapotranspiration and percentage of sand. The regression results indicated that relief and percentage of sand were highly correlated to base flow index, and the amount of base flow volume can be related to gradient and the amount of effective rainfall. The regression results also suggested that the descriptive variables used in constructing the {HLR} can be used to define mean values of shallow ground water flow within the regions. Further testing is needed to ascertain if such relationships could be used to define flow within an {HLR.} (C) 2007 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

This study examines the potential impacts of climate change on freshwater fish distributions in Canada. Climate normals data (means from 1961 to 1990) from Environment Canada were used to map current climate found throughout the tertiary watersheds of Canada. Logistic regressions based on these climate data were used to develop predictive presence-absence equations for (a) common commercially and recreationally important species and (b) an Arctic freshwater species and a freshwater fish species of conservation significance listed by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife ({COSEWIC).} The Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis Global Coupled Model 2({IS92a)} provided forecasts of Canada's climate in 2020 and 2050. The data from this scenario and the logistic regressions provided a ready framework for predicting the potential distributions of the fishes. Physical and ecological barriers would have to be overcome for the distribution of these species to actually change in response to climate change. Generally, coldwater species may be extirpated from much of their present range while cool and warm-water species may expand northward. Species that are limited to the most southern regions of the country may expand northwards. A conceptual framework for assessing potential climate change impacts on fishes and the variety of management strategies required to deal with these impacts are discussed. Our forecasts demonstrate the need for climate change assessments in species at risk as well as for common species.},

	abstract = {The utility of hydrologic indices for describing various aspects of streamflow regimes has resulted in their increased application in riverine research. Consequently, researchers are now confronted with the task of having to choose among a large number of competing hydrologic indices to reduce computational effort and variable redundancy prior to statistical analyses, while still adequately representing the major facets of the flow regime. The present study addresses this concern by providing a comprehensive review of 171 currently available hydrologic indices (including the commonly used Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration) using long-term flow records from 420 sites from across the continental {USA.} We highlight patterns of redundancy among these hydrologic indices and provide a number of statistically and ecologically based recommendations for the selection of a reduced set of indices that can simultaneously (1) explain a dominant proportion of statistical variation in the complete set of hydrologic indices and (2) minimize multicollinearity while still adequately representing recognized, critical attributes of the flow regime. In addition, we examine the transferability of hydrologic indices across `stream types' by identifying indices that consistently explain dominant patterns of variance across streams in varying climatic and geologic environments. Together, our results provide a framework from which researchers can identify hydrologic indices that adequately characterize flow regimes in a non-redundant manner. In combination with ecological knowledge, this framework can guide researchers in the parsimonious selection of hydrologic indices for future hydroecological studies.

	abstract = {Changes in land use can potentially reduce the quality of fish habitat and affect the economic value of commercial and sport fisheries that rely on the affected stocks. Parks and protected areas that restrict land-use activities provide benefits, such as ecosystem services, in addition to recreation and preservation of wildlife. Placing values on these other benefits of protected areas poses a major challenge for land-use planning. In this paper, we present a framework for valuing benefits for fisheries from protecting areas from degradation, using the example of the Strait of Georgia coho salmon fishery in southern British Columbia, Canada. Our study improves upon previous methods used to value fish habitat in two major respects. First, we use a bioeconomic model of the coho fishery to derive estimates of value that are consistent with economic theory. Second, we estimate the value of changing the quality of fish habitat by using empirical analyses to link fish population dynamics with indices of land use in surrounding watersheds. In our example, we estimated that the value of protecting habitat ecosystem services is C\$0.93 to C\$2.63 per ha of drainage basin or about C\$1322 to C\$7010 per km of salmon stream length (C\$1.00 = {US\$0.71).} Sensitivity analyses suggest that these values are relatively robust to different assumptions, and if anything, are likely to be minimum estimates. Thus, when comparing alternative uses of land, managers should consider ecosystem services from maintaining habitat for productive fish populations along with other benefits of protected areas.

The salmon die after spawning, and the nutrients and energy in their bodies, derived almost entirely from marine sources, are deposited in the freshwater ecosystems. This represents a vital input to the ecosystems used as spawning grounds. Salmon-derived nutrients make up a substantial fraction of the plants and animals in aquatic and terrestrial habitats associated with healthy salmon populations. The decline of salmon numbers throughout much of their southern range in North America has prompted concern that the elimination of this "conveyor belt" of nutrients and energy may fundamentally change the productivity of these coastal freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, and consequently their ability to support wildlife, including salmon. If progress is to be made towards understanding and conserving the connection between migratory salmon and coastal ecosystems, scientists and decision-makers must explore and understand the vast temporal and spatial scales that characterize this relationship.},

Anomalously high unit discharges suggest that topographically defined watersheds may not correspond to aquifer boundaries, and oxygen isotope data reveal that mean recharge elevations for the springs are coincident with extensive Holocene lava fields. The He-{3/He-4} ratios in most of the springs are close to atmospheric, implying shallow flow paths, and aquifer thicknesses are estimated to be 30-140 m.

We present a conceptual framework and empirical review of the interactive effects of climate change and invasive species in freshwater ecosystems, Climate change is expected to result in warmer water temperatures, shorter duration of ice cover, altered streamflow patterns, increased salinization, and increased demand for water storage and conveyance structures. These changes will alter the pathways by which non-native species enter aquatic systems by expanding fish-culture facilities and water gardens to new areas and by facilitating the spread of species during floods. Climate change will influence the likelihood of new species becoming established by eliminating cold temperatures or winter hypoxia that currently prevent survival and by increasing the construction of reservoirs that serve as hotspots for invasive species. Climate change will modify the ecological impacts of invasive species by enhancing their competitive and predatory effects on native species and by increasing the virulence of some diseases. As a result of climate change, new prevention and control strategies such as barrier construction or removal efforts may be needed to control invasive species that currently have only moderate effects or that are limited by seasonally unfavorable conditions, Although most researchers focus on how climate change will increase the number and severity of invasions, some invasive coldwater species may be unable to persist under the new climate conditions. Our findings highlight the complex interactions between climate change and invasive species that will influence how aquatic ecosystems and their biota will respond to novel environmental conditions.},

Freshwater ecologists have explored spatial patterns in stream networks using hydrologic distance measures and new geostatistical methodologies have recently been developed that enable directional hydrologic distance measures to be considered. The purpose of this study was to quantify patterns of spatial correlation in stream water chemistry using three distance measures: straight-line distance, symmetric hydrologic distance, and weighted asymmetric hydrologic distance. We used a dataset collected in Maryland, {USA} to develop both general linear models and geostatistical models (based on the three distance measures) for acid neutralizing capacity, conductivity, {pH}, nitrate, sulfate, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and dissolved organic carbon. The spatial {AICC} methodology allowed us to fit the autocorrelation and covariate parameters simultaneously and to select the model with the most support in the data. We used the universal kriging algorithm to generate geostatistical model predictions. We found that spatial correlation exists in stream chemistry data at a relatively coarse scale and that geostatistical models consistently improved the accuracy of model predictions. More than one distance measure performed well for most chemical response variables, but straight-line distance appears to be the most suitable distance measure for regional geostatistical modeling. It may be necessary to develop new survey designs that more fully capture spatial correlation at a variety of scales to improve the use of weighted asymmetric hydrologic distance measures in regional geostatistical models.},

Such methodological developments primarily relate to maximum likelihood estimation in the presence of covariates, in combination with either the block maxima or peaks over threshold approaches. Topics that are treated include trends in hydrologic extremes, with the anticipated intensification of the hydrologic cycle as part of global climate change. In an attempt to link downscaling (i.e., relating large-scale atmosphere-ocean circulation to smaller-scale hydrologic variables) with the statistics of extremes, statistical downscaling of hydrologic extremes is considered. Future challenges are reviewed, such as the development of more rigorous statistical methodology for regional analysis of extremes, as well as the extension of Bayesian methods to more fully quantify uncertainty in extremal estimation. Examples include precipitation and streamflow extremes, as well as economic damage associated with such extreme events, with consideration of trends and dependence on patterns in atmosphere-ocean circulation (e.g., El Nino phenomenon).

This risk extends to salmonids, the most widespread threatened and endangered species in the Pacific Northwest. Pacific salmonids traverse large geographic areas that include freshwater, estuarine, and ocean habitats in which they encounter numerous nonnative species. For this article, we examined the extent to which introduced species are a risk to threatened and endangered salmon. We identified all documented nonindigenous species in the Pacific Northwest, including fish, invertebrates, birds, plants, and amphibians. Where data exist, we quantified the impact of nonindigenous species on threatened and endangered salmonids. The results indicate that the effect of nonindigenous species on salmon could equal or exceed that of four commonly addressed causes of adverse impacts - habitat alteration, harvest, hatcheries, and the hydrosystem; we suggest that managing nonindigenous species may be imperative for salmon recovery.},

We use downscaled outputs from general circulation models coupled with a hydrologic model to forecast the effects of altered flows and increased temperatures on four interacting species of trout across the interior western United States (1.01 million km(2)), based on empirical statistical models built from fish surveys at 9,890 sites. Projections under the 2080s {A1B} emissions scenario forecast a mean 47\% decline in total suitable habitat for all trout, a group of fishes of major socioeconomic and ecological significance. We project that native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii, already excluded from much of its potential range by nonnative species, will lose a further 58\% of habitat due to an increase in temperatures beyond the species' physiological optima and continued negative biotic interactions. Habitat for nonnative brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis and brown trout Salmo trutta is predicted to decline by 77\% and 48\%, respectively, driven by increases in temperature and winter flood frequency caused by warmer, rainier winters. Habitat for rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, is projected to decline the least (35\%) because negative temperature effects are partly offset by flow regime shifts that benefit the species. These results illustrate how drivers other than temperature influence species response to climate change. Despite some uncertainty, large declines in trout habitat are likely, but our findings point to opportunities for strategic targeting of mitigation efforts to appropriate stressors and locations.},

	abstract = {Future alterations in land cover and climate are likely to cause substantial changes in the ranges of fish species. Predictive distribution models are an important tool for assessing the probability that these changes will cause increases or decreases in or the extirpation of species. Classification tree models that predict the probability of game fish presence were applied to the streams of the Muskegon River watershed, Michigan. The models were used to study three potential future scenarios: (1) land cover change only, (2) land cover change and a 3 degrees C increase in air temperature by 2100, and (3) land cover change and a 5 degrees C increase in air temperature by 2100. The analysis indicated that the expected change in air temperature and subsequent change in water temperatures would result in the decline of coldwater fish in the Muskegon watershed by the end of the 21st century while cool-and warmwater species would significantly increase their ranges. The greatest decline detected was a 90\% reduction in the probability that brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis would occur in Bigelow Creek. The greatest increase was a 276\% increase in the probability that northern pike Esox lucius would occur in the Middle Branch River. Changes in land cover are expected to cause large changes in a few fish species, such as walleye Sander vitreus and Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, but not to drive major changes in species composition. Managers can alter stream environmental conditions to maximize the probability that species will reside in particular stream reaches through application of the classification tree models. Such models represent a good way to predict future changes, as they give quantitative estimates of the n-dimensional niches for particular species.},

However, no study (based on actual data) has assessed the influence of the global warming on communities in rivers. We analyzed long-term series of fish (1979-1999) and invertebrate (1980-1999) data from the Upper Rhone River at Bugey to test the influence of climatic warming on both communities. Between the periods of 1979-1981 and 1997-1999, the average water temperature of the Upper Rhone River at Bugey has increased by about {1.5degreesC} due to atmospheric warming. In the same period, several dams have been built from 12.5 to 85 km upstream of our study segment and a nuclear power plant has been built on it. Changes in the community structure were summarized using multivariate analysis. The variability of fish abundance was correlated with discharge and temperature during the reproduction period (April-June): low flows and high temperatures coincided with high fish abundance. Beyond abundance patterns, southern, thermophilic fish species (e.g. chub, and barbel) as well as downstream, thermophilic invertebrate taxa (e.g. Athricops, Potamopyrgus) progressively replaced northern, cold-water fish species (e.g. dace) and upstream, cold-water invertebrate taxa (e.g. Chloroperla, Protoneumura). These patterns were significantly correlated with thermal variables, suggesting that shifts were the consequences of climatic warming. All analyses were carried out using statistics appropriate for autocorrelated time series. Our results were consistent with previous studies dealing with relationships between fish or invertebrates and water temperature, and with predictions of the impact of climatic change on freshwater communities. The potential confounding factors (i.e. dams and the nuclear power plant) did not seem to influence the observed trends.},

	abstract = {Abundance-occupancy relationships comprise some of the most general and well-explored patterns in macro-ecology. The theory governing these relationships predicts that species will exhibit a positive interspecific and intraspecific relationship between regional occupancy and local abundance. Abundance-occupancy relationships have important implications in using distributional surveys, such as atlases, to understand and document large-scale population dynamics and the consequences of environmental change. A basic need for interpreting such data bases is a better understanding of whether changes in regional occupancy reflect changes in local abundance across species of varying life-history characteristics. Our objective was to test the predictions of the abundance-occupancy rule using two independent data sets, the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas and the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The New York State Breeding Bird Atlas consists of 5332 25-km(2) survey blocks and is one of the first atlases in the {USA} to be completed for two time periods (1980-85 and 2000-05). The North American Breeding Survey is a large-scale annual survey intended to document the relative abundance and population change of songbirds throughout the {USA.} We found that regional occupancy was positively correlated with relative abundance across 98 (beta = 0.60 +/- 0.11 {SE}, P {\textless} 0.001, R(2) = 0.60) and 85 species (beta = 0.67 +/- 0.06 {SE}, P {\textless} 0.001, R(2) = 0.57) in two separate time periods. This relationship proved stable over time and was notably consistent between breeding habitat groups and migratory guilds. Between 1980 and 2005, changes in regional occupancy were highly correlated with long-term abundance trend estimates for 75 species (beta = 5.73 +/- 0.24 {SE}, P {\textless} 0.001, R(2) = 0.88). Over a 20-year period, woodland and resident birds showed an increase in occupancy while grassland species showed the greatest decline; these patterns were mirrored by changes in local abundance. Although exceptions existed, we found most changes in occupancy parallel changes in local abundance. These findings support the basic predictions of the abundance-occupancy rule and demonstrate its consistency and stability in species and groups of varying life-history characteristics.},

Canada. In these two lakes, years with warmer air temperatures produced an earlier onset of stratification, a warmer epilimnion a larger thermal gradient, and a shallower thermocline. Lake Opeongo smallmouth bass. which are at the northern edge of the species' distribution, grew better as the availability and duration of warmer epilimnetic water temperature increased. Notable climate signals in the growth of smallmouth bass were detected in 1992, a cool year due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo, and in 1983, the strongest El Nino year in the database. Lake trout growth was poorer in years of early stratification, but was not otherwise associated with stratification variables, suggesting that springtime feeding on littoral prey is a major determinant of growth for this hypolimnetic species. The growth of young rainbow smelt, which feed in the epilimnion, declined when epilimnion volumes contracted but older smelt, which occupy the hypolimnion. grew better. Greater growth of yellow perch was also associated with a shallower, more isothermal epilimnion. Stratification characteristics that reflected the thermal and feeding habitats' spatial or temporal boundaries accounted for, on average, 44\% of the variation in fish growth. Our findings should be useful in forecasting how climate change signals may filter through thermal habitats and effect fish growth.},

Â© 2007 The Authors Journal compilation Â© 2007 Blackwell {MunksgaardAbstract}Â 2013 The relative influence of temperature versus local physical factors on the spatial distribution of riverine fish species was investigated in a large watershed of south-western France. Using generalised additive models and hierarchical partitioning, we modelled the ecological responses of 28 fish species to a set of five environmental predictors, and we quantified the independent effect of each predictor. The spatial distribution of fish species was primarily determined by both mean temperature and position along the upstream2013downstream gradient. However, responses to these environmental factors varied according to the species considered. Fish species with strong thermal requirements (e.g., common carp, black bullhead, Atlantic salmon) were mainly sensitive to temperature whereas longitudinal gradient was of primary importance for downstream species (e.g., common bream, largemouth bass, pike perch). Both the statistical methods used gave concordant results and appeared complementary. This dual-approach, quantifying the relative contribution of each environmental factor, appears particularly useful to understand the spatial distribution of stream fish species. Separating the effects of temperature versus habitat factors is crucial to accurately predict species distribution modifications in the current context of global change.},

Some of the embryos rested on porous plates, while others were buried in glass beads so as to simulate natural conditions more closely. Fry from embryos reared at low and intermediate oxygen concentrations hatched later and were smaller in size at hatching than fry from embryos reared at concentrations near the air-saturation level. At all oxygen concentrations tested, reduced water velocities resulted in reduced size of hatching fry. This effect of velocity was nearly as pronounced at high oxygen concentrations as at low concentrations. The effect of the difference of water velocities tested was less than the effect of the difference of oxygen concentrations tested. When some embryos were buried in glass beads while others were not, and the discharge rates of water through cylinders containing the embryos were the same, the fry that hatched in the cylinders containing beads were larger in size than those in cylinders without beads. This effect is ascribed to the increase of water velocities around the embryos buried in beads. It was usually most pronounced when a mixture of large and small beads was used.},

In the case of Michigan trout streams, landscape analyses suggest a predictable community shaped by large-scale patterns in hydrology and geology. Most site-based studies, however, suggest these communities are highly variable in structure over time, and are strongly shaped by site-specific physical and biological dynamics. As the real world is comprised of processes operating both at local and landscape scales, an analytical framework for integrating these paradigms is desirable. 2. Decomposition of variances by factorial {ANOVA} into time, space and time-space interaction terms can provide a conceptual and analytical model for integrating processes operating at landscape and local scales. Using this approach, long-term data sets were examined for three insects and two fishes common in Michigan trout streams. Each taxon had a unique variance structure, and the observed variance structure was highly dependent upon sample size. 3. Both spatially extensive designs with little sampling over time (typical of many {GIS} studies) and temporally extensive designs with little or no spatial sampling (typical of population and community studies), are biased in terms of their view of the relative importance of local and landscape factors. The necessary, but in many cases costly, solution is to develop and analyse data sets that are both spatially and temporally extensive.},

	abstract = {Hydrologic landscapes are multiples or variations of fundamental hydrologic landscape units. A fundamental hydrologic landscape unit is defined on the basis of land-surface form, geology, and climate. The basic land-surface form of a fundamental hydrologic landscape unit is an upland separated from a lowland by an intervening steeper slope. Fundamental hydrologic landscape units have a complete hydrologic system consisting of surface runoff, ground-water flow, and interaction with atmospheric water. By describing actual landscapes in terms of land-surface slope, hydraulic properties of soils and geologic framework, and the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration, the hydrologic system of actual landscapes can be conceptualized in a uniform way. This conceptual framework can then be the foundation for design of studies and data networks, syntheses of information on local to national scales, and comparison of process research across small study units in a variety of settings. The Crow Wing River watershed in central Minnesota is used as an example of evaluating stream discharge in the context of hydrologic landscapes. Lake-research watersheds in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Nebraska are used as an example of using the hydrologic-landscapes concept to evaluate the effect of ground water on the degree of mineralization and major-ion chemistry of lakes that lie within ground-water flow systems.},

We examined over 9,700 smallmouth bass stomachs from April through August during 1996 and 1997. Juvenile salmonids were not a major component of smallmouth bass diets by weight and number at any location in either 1996 or 1997. Of the approximately 8,600 stomach samples containing food items, only 67 had juvenile salmonid remains. Juvenile salmonids accounted for approximately 11\% of smallmouth bass diets by weight in the forebay in 1996 and 5\% in the Snake and Clearwater river arms in 1997, with smaller proportions at other locations. Crustaceans and nonsalmonid fishes were the dominant prey items by weight at all locations in 1996 and 1997 except for the Snake River arm in 1996, where macroinvertebrates were dominant. Monthly consumption rates (smolts/bass/d) of juvenile salmonids by smallmouth bass were highest in the forebay (0.02) in April 1996 and in the restricted zone of the forebay (0.05) in July 1997. We estimated that approximately 17,500 (1996: 6,728; 1997: 10,809) juvenile salmonids were consumed by smallmouth bass from April through August in 1996 and 1997. High flows and resulting lower water temperatures and higher turbidity in the Lower Granite Reservoir during our study probably affected salmonid predation rates by smallmouth bass. Management efforts directed at enhancing migratory conditions for juvenile salmonids (e.g., higher flows, lower water temperatures, and higher turbidity) will probably also reduce predation from smallmouth bass.},

Understanding, preserving, and restoring connectivity in complex landscapes requires connectivity models and metrics that are reliable, efficient, and process based. We introduce a new class of ecological connectivity models based in electrical circuit theory. Although they have been applied in other disciplines, circuit-theoretic connectivity models are new to ecology. They offer distinct advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Resistance, current, and voltage calculated across graphs or raster grids can be related to ecological processes ( such as individual movement and gene flow) that occur across large population networks or landscapes. Efficient algorithms can quickly solve networks with millions of nodes, or landscapes with millions of raster cells. Here we review basic circuit theory, discuss relationships between circuit and random walk theories, and describe applications in ecology, evolution, and conservation. We provide examples of how circuit models can be used to predict movement patterns and fates of random walkers in complex landscapes and to identify important habitat patches and movement corridors for conservation planning.},

The approach is based on the understanding that salmonid Stocks are adapted to local freshwater conditions and that their environments are naturally temporally dynamic. In this context, we define a goal of restoring the natural rates and magnitudes of habitat-forming processes, and we allow for locally defined restoration priorities. The goal requires that historical reconstruction focus on diagnosing disruptions to processes rather than conditions. Historical reconstruction defines the suite of restoration tasks, which then may be prioritized based on local biological objectives, We illustrate the use of this approach for two habitat-forming processes: sediment supply and stream shading. We also briefly contrast this approach to several others that maybe used as components of a restoration strategy.},

	abstract = {Across the western Great Plains of North America, groundwater pumping for irrigated agriculture is depleting regional aquifers that sustain streamflow for native fishes. We investigated linkages between groundwater pumping from the High Plains Aquifer and stream fish habitat loss at multiple spatial scales during spring and summer 2005â2007 in the Arikaree River, eastern Colorado, {USA.} Monthly low-altitude flights showed that flowing reaches were reduced from about 65 to â©½15 km by late summer, and long permanently dry segments in the lower basin prevent recolonization. Drying occurred rapidly during summer within three 6Â·4-km river segments, and patterns in habitat connectivity varied among segments owing to hydraulic conductivity. Most refuge pool habitats dried completely or lost more than half their volume, disconnecting from other pools by late summer. On the basis of these empirical habitat data, and historical groundwater and streamflow data, we constructed a {MODFLOW} model to predict how groundwater pumping will affect water table levels and fish habitat under three future scenarios. Under the most conservative scenario, we predicted that only 57\% of refuge pools will remain in 35 years (2045), nearly all isolated in a 1Â·7-km fragment of river. A water balance model indicated that maintaining current water table levels and refuge pools for fishes would require a 75\% reduction in groundwater pumping, which is not economically or politically feasible. Given widespread streamflow declines, ecological futures are bleak for stream fishes in the western Great Plains, and managers will be challenged to conserve native fishes under current groundwater pumping regimes.

Consequently, some analytical methods used to quantify relationships in other types of ecological networks, or in 2-D space, may be inadequate for studying the influence of structure and connectivity on ecological processes within {DENs.} We propose a conceptual taxonomy of network analysis methods that account for {DEN} characteristics to varying degrees and provide a synthesis of the different approaches within the context of stream ecology. Within this context, we summarise the key innovations of a new family of spatial statistical models that describe spatial relationships in {DENs.} Finally, we discuss how different network analyses may be combined to address more complex and novel research questions. While our main focus is streams, the taxonomy of network analyses is also relevant anywhere spatial patterns in both network and 2-D space can be used to explore the influence of multi-scale processes on biota and their habitat (e.g. plant morphology and pest infestation, or preferential migration along stream or road corridors).},

Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountain top species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.},

	abstract = {Current rates of climate change are unprecedented, and biological responses to these changes have also been rapid at the levels of ecosystems, communities, and species. Most research on climate change effects on biodiversity has concentrated on the terrestrial realm, and considerable changes in terrestrial biodiversity and species' distributions have already been detected in response to climate change. The studies that have considered organisms in the freshwater realm have also shown that freshwater biodiversity is highly vulnerable to climate change, with extinction rates and extirpations of freshwater species matching or exceeding those suggested for better-known terrestrial taxa. There is some evidence that freshwater species have exhibited range shifts in response to climate change in the last millennia, centuries, and decades. However, the effects are typically species-specific, with cold-water organisms being generally negatively affected and warm-water organisms positively affected. However, detected range shifts are based on findings from a relatively low number of taxonomic groups, samples from few freshwater ecosystems, and few regions. The lack of a wider knowledge hinders predictions of the responses of much of freshwater biodiversity to climate change and other major anthropogenic stressors. Due to the lack of detailed distributional information for most freshwater taxonomic groups and the absence of distribution-climate models, future studies should aim at furthering our knowledge about these aspects of the ecology of freshwater organisms. Such information is not only important with regard to the basic ecological issue of predicting the responses of freshwater species to climate variables, but also when assessing the applied issue of the capacity of protected areas to accommodate future changes in the distributions of freshwater species. This is a huge challenge, because most current protected areas have not been delineated based on the requirements of freshwater organisms. Thus, the requirements of freshwater organisms should be taken into account in the future delineation of protected areas and in the estimation of the degree to which protected areas accommodate freshwater biodiversity in the changing climate and associated environmental changes.},

Primary sources of variation include elevation datum and portion of the egg pocket referenced to; differences in spawning behavior and the number, thickness, and location of egg pockets; relationships between egg depth, fish species, and corresponding size of female and spawning substrate and velocity characteristics; sampling method; presence of excavation barriers; redd superimposition; and scour and fill by hydraulic and other mechanical processes. Such sources of variability in the reported data have important implications for studies of scouring processes in salmonid spawning areas that require accurate identification of egg burial depths for predicting and preventing potential scour impacts. Cumulative measurement error and unexplained variation may amount to 5-20 cm or more in published values. The most relevant data for scour impact assessments are depths from the original stream bed elevation down to the top of the main egg pocket. Frequency distribution data are needed for determining probabilities and cumulative levels of scour impacts and for managing genetic diversity as well as population size. Preliminary depth threshold criteria are proposed for use now, pending further research.},

For each of the 106 species present in the data set, six categories of species traits were derived to describe habitat, trophic, morphological, and tolerance characteristics. A hierarchical clustering routine was used to identify two functionally similar groups of assemblages defined in terms of species presence/absence, Hydrological factors describing streamflow variability and predictability, as well as frequency and predictability of high flow and low flow extremes, were derived for each of the 34 sites and employed to explain differences among the functionally defined groups. Canonical discriminant analysis revealed that the hydrological data could clearly separate the two ecologically defined groups of assemblages, which were associated with either hydrologically variable streams (high coefficient of variation of daily flows, moderate frequency of spates) or hydrologically stable streams (high predictability of daily flows, stable baseflow conditions). Discriminant functions based on hydrological information classified the 34 fish assemblages into the correct ecological group with 85\% accuracy. Assemblages from hydrologically variable sites had generalized feeding strategies, were associated with silt and general substrata, were characterized by slow-velocity species with headwater affinities, and were tolerant to silt. Proportions of species traits present at the 34 sites were regressed against an index of hydrological stability derived from a principal components analysis to test the hypothesis that functional organization of assemblages varied across a gradient of hydrological stability. Results were complementary with the discriminant analysis. Findings were in general agreement with theoretical predictions that variable habitats should support resource generalists while stable habitats should be characterized by a higher proportion of specialist species. Several species of fish were identified as indicative of the variable-stable hydrological gradient among stream sites, A taxonomic analysis showed strong geographic patterns in species composition of the 34 assemblages. However, zoogeographic constraints did not explain the observed relationship between stream hydrology and functional organization of fish assemblages, The strong hydrological-assemblage relations found in the 34 midwestern sites suggest that hydrological factors are significant environmental variables influencing fish assemblage structure, and that hydrological alterations induced by climate change (or other anthropogenic disturbances) could modify stream fish assemblage structure in this region.},

	abstract = {P{\textgreater}1. In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s) with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i) relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that act over broad spatio-temporal scales {\textgreater} 1000 km2 and {\textgreater} 100 years); (ii) dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales similar to 1-1000 km2 and {\textless} 1-100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural connections experienced by fish. 2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals. As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and management of connectivity for riverine fishes. 3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity and defining acceptable alterations. Multiscale analyses are most likely to identify dominant patterns of connections and disconnections, and the appropriate scale at which to focus conservation activities.},

Comparisons of observations with simulations from an energy balance climate model indicate that as much as 41 to 64\% of preanthropogenic (pre-1850) decadal-scale temperature variations was due to changes in solar irradiance and volcanism. Removal of the forced response from reconstructed temperature time series yields residuals that show similar variability to those of control runs of coupled models, thereby lending support to the models' value as estimates of low-frequency variability in the climate system. Removal of all forcing except greenhouse gases from the similar to 1000-year time series results in a residual with a very large late-20th-century warming that closely agrees with the response predicted from greenhouse gas forcing. The combination of a unique level of temperature increase in the late 20th century and improved constraints on the role of natural variability provides further evidence that the greenhouse effect has already established itself above the level of natural variability in the climate system. A 21st-century global warming projection far exceeds the natural variability of the past 1000 years and is greater than the best estimate of global temperature change for the last interglacial.},

	abstract = {Mean summer water temperatures in the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) have increased by similar to 1.5 degrees C since the 1950s. In recent years, record high river temperatures during spawning migrations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been associated with high mortality events, raising concerns about long-term viability of the numerous natal stocks faced with climate warming. In this study, the effect of freshwater thermal experience on spawning migration survival was estimated by fitting capture-recapture models to telemetry data collected for 1474 adults (captured in either the ocean or river between 2002 and 2007) from four Fraser River sockeye salmon stock-aggregates (Chilko, Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams). Survival of Adams sockeye salmon was the most impacted by warm temperatures encountered in the lower river, followed by that of Stellako-Late Stuart and Quesnel. In contrast, survival of Chilko fish was insensitive to the encountered river temperature. In all stocks, in-river survival of ocean-captured sockeye salmon was higher than that of river-captured fish and, generally, the difference was more pronounced under warm temperatures. The survival-temperature relationships for ocean-captured fish were used to predict historic (1961-1990) and future (2010-2099) survival under simulated lower river thermal experiences for the Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams stocks. A decrease of 9-16\% in survival of all these stocks was predicted by the end of the century if the Fraser River continues to warm as expected. However, the decrease in future survival of Adams sockeye salmon would occur only if fish continue to enter the river abnormally early, towards warmer periods of the summer, as they have done since 1995. The survival estimates and predictions presented here are likely optimistic and emphasize the need to consider stock-specific responses to temperature and climate warming into fisheries management and conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Design flows estimated by flood hydrograph simulation can be reasonably accurate or greatly in error, depending upon 
the modeling procedures and inputs selected. The objectives of this research project were (1) to determine which combinations of 
modeling procedures and inputs yield the best discharge estimates under various conditions and (2) to develop specific guidelines 
for flood hydrograph simulation for possible inclusion in the {KDOT} Design Manual. 
Many different combinations of modeling procedures and inputs were tested in flood simulations for 66 gaged watersheds 
in Kansas. The test watersheds were all primarily rural with unregulated streams, drainage areas under 50 km2
 and gaging records 
of 20 years or longer. The simulations were performed with the {HEC-1} computer program of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
The key inputs were the duration of the hypothetical frequency-based storm and the antecedent moisture condition ({AMC)} in the 
{NRCS} loss model. Floods with six different recurrence intervals (2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 years) were simulated using four 
different storm durations (3, 6, 12 and 24 hours), five different antecedent moisture conditions ({AMC} 2, 2Â¼, 2Â½, 2Â¾ and 3) and the 
two different unit-hydrograph models ({NRCS} and Snyder). The results for the watersheds in eastern and western Kansas were 
analyzed separately. We computed the bias and standard error of the simulated flows, relative to the gage-based estimates, for 
each combination of recurrence interval, storm duration, {AMC} and unit-hydrograph model in each region. From these results, we 
identified combinations of storm durations and {AMCs} that yield unbiased discharge estimates for each set of conditions. Longer 
storm durations and/or higher {AMCs} are needed for higher recurrence intervals. The storm durations are shorter and the {AMCs} 
are lower in the western region than in the eastern region. 
Flood hydrograph simulation with the recommended inputs is approximately as accurate as the {USGS} regression 
equations in eastern Kansas and more accurate than the {USGS} regression equations in western Kansas. The standard errors of the 
simulated flows are larger in western Kansas than in eastern Kansas. 
We recommend simplified guidelines for flood hydrograph simulation for inclusion in the {KDOT} Design Manual, 
Volume I, Part C. These guidelines specify the {NRCS} {UH} model and a single combination of storm duration and {AMC} for each 
recurrence interval and region.},

(The term "watersheds" is defined in this paper as the drainage areas of tributary streams, headwater streams, and stream segments lying between two confluences.) The analyses grouped the watersheds into 20 noncontiguous regions based on similarities in land-surface form, geologic texture, and climate characteristics. The percentage of explained variance (R-squared value) in an analysis of variance was used to compare the hydrologic-landscape regions to 19 square geometric regions and the 21 {U.S.} Environmental Protection Agency level-{II} ecoregions. Hydrologic-landscape regions generally were better than ecoregions at delineating regions of distinct land-surface form and geologic texture. Hydrologic-landscape regions and ecoregions were equally effective at defining regions in terms of climate, land cover, and water-quality characteristics. For about half of the landscape, climate, and water-quality characteristics, the R-squared values of square geometric regions were as high as hydrologic-landscape regions or ecoregions.},

We evaluated the strategies based on their accuracy (confidence interval coverage), precision (relative standard error) and cost (based on travel time). Accuracy increased with increasing number of redds, increasing sample size, and smaller sampling units. The total number of redds in the watershed and budgetary constraints influenced which strategies were most precise and effective. For years with very few redds ({\textless}0.15 redds.km (1)), a stratified sampling strategy and inexpensive strategies were most efficient, whereas for year with more redds (0.15-2.9 redds.km (1)) either of two more expensive systematic strategies were most precise.},

	abstract = {1. Relatively undisturbed streams in continental {U.S.A.} were classified according to variation in ten ecologically relevant hydrological characteristics. Measures of flow variability and predictability for average conditions, as well as for low- and high-flow extremes, were extracted from long-term (15-58-year) daily streamflow data for 806 streams. 2. Two groups of sites were analysed: all 806 sites and a subset of 420 `best' sites. For each group, cluster analysis identified ten distinctive stream types, seven permanent and three intermittent. The geographical clustering exhibited by the stream types indicated regional differences in climatic and geological features. A bootstrapping technique applied to the permanent stream classes showed the majority of them were statistically robust. 3. The derived classification of {U.S.} streams based on ecologically relevant hydrological characteristics provides a comprehensive catalogue of small to mid-size streams that, according to ecological theory, may differ in major aspects of their ecological organization. The classification provides a basis for hypothesis generation and affords an objective framework for matching streams for purposes of comparative ecological investigations. 4. A subset of 118 streams from the ten classification groups was selected to determine whether certain hydrological variables often used by ecologists to make cross-system comparisons are sensitive to the temporal coarseness of the hydrological time series used to derive the variables. The three hydrological variables considered were streamflow predictability, streamflow variability and flood timing. 5. Streamflow predictability (using Colwell's Index) was calculated at daily, weekly, monthly and seasonal time stales. Estimates of predictability showed either no change across time scales, a gradual and consistent increase across time scales, or a maximum value at the monthly time scale. Coefficient of variation of streamflow was calculated at daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual time steps. Daily values were always greatest for all streams. Some groups showed minimum variability at the monthly scale, others at the seasonal. Timing of daily peak flows could be detected with 50-90\% accuracy across stream groups using coarser grain monthly and annual hydrographic data. 6. Inferences about hydrological similarity among streams across broad geographical scales can be sensitive to choice of time scale used in the hydrological characterization.},

	abstract = {Modeling nonpoint-source phosphorus (P) loading from land to surface waters can be both complex and data intensive. Our goal was to develop a simple model that would account for spatial pattern in topography and land use using geographic information system ({GIS)} databases. We estimated areas of the watershed that strongly contributed to P loading by approximating overland flow, and modeled annual P loading by fitting three parameters to data obtained by stream monitoring. We calibrated the model using P loading data from two years of contrasting annual precipitation for Lake Mendota, a Wisconsin eutrophic lake in a watershed dominated by agriculture and urban lands. Land-use scenarios were developed to estimate annual P loading from pre-settlement and future land uses. As much as half of the Lake Mendota watershed did not contribute significantly to annual P loading. The greatest contribution to loading came from a heterogeneous riparian corridor that varied in width from 0.1 km to approximate to 6 km depending on topography and runoff conditions. We estimate that loading from pre-settlement land use was one-sixth of the loading from present land use. A future scenario, representing an 80\% increase in existing urban land (from 9 to 16\% of total watershed area, which would be reached in 30 yr with current land-use trends), showed only modest increases in annual P loading but possible significant effects on water quality. If the watershed were to become entirely urbanized, P loading to the lake would double and potential effects on water quality would be severe. Changes in P loading were strongest with conversions of undisturbed vegetated lands, especially riparian areas, to either urban or agricultural uses. Variability in total annual rainfall leads to variability in the riparian area that affects P loading, with implications for policies intended to control nonpoint nutrient inputs.},

	abstract = {Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on each method's ability to produce precipitation and other variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at much higher spatial resolution than the climate model. Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective ( 1975 1995) climate simulation produced by the {NCAR-DOE} Parallel Climate Model ({PCM)}, and the implications of the comparison for a future ( 2040 - 2060) {PCM} climate scenario were also explored. The six approaches were made up of three relatively simple statistical downscaling methods - linear interpolation ({LI)}, spatial disaggregation ({SD)}, and bias-correction and spatial disaggregation ({BCSD)} - each applied to both {PCM} output directly ( at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical downscaling via a Regional {ClimateModel} ({RCM} - at 1/2-degree spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation, and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the hydrologic model with observations. The most significant findings are that the {BCSD} method was successful in reproducing the main features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective climate simulation, when applied to both {PCM} and {RCMoutputs.} Linear interpolation produced better results using {RCM} output than {PCM} output, but both methods ({PCM-LI} and {RCM-LI)} lead to unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial disaggregation of the {PCM} output produced results similar to those achieved with the {RCM} interpolated output; nonetheless, neither {PCM} nor {RCM} output was useful for hydrologic simulation purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate scenario, only the {BCSD-method} ( using {PCM} or {RCM)} was able to produce hydrologically plausible results. With the {BCSD} method, the {RCM-derived} hydrology was more sensitive to climate change than the {PCM-derived} hydrology.},

	abstract = {The rate of evolution and the scope for phenotypic plasticity can be assessed by studying the adaptation of an introduced population to a new habitat and the response of established populations to progressive environmental change. Adult American shad (Alosa sapidissima), an introduced species, and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a native species, migrate up the Columbia River (northwestern United States) in late spring and early summer to spawn. Based on records from Bonneville Dam, the river's spring warming has occurred progressively earlier since approximate to 1950, coinciding with a reduction in spring discharge. The date when 50\% of the shad migrated past the dam is correlated with this shift in thermal and flow regimes; they now ascend the river approximate to 38 d earlier than they did in 1938. However, the mean temperature that they experience has actually decreased by 1.8 degrees C in 45 yr, indicating that the change in their migratory timing has outstripped the rate of environmental change. The upriver migration of sockeye salmon is also earlier than in past years, but their change in timing (approximate to 6 d since 1949) lags behind the rate of environmental change, and they are now experiencing approximate to 2.5 degrees C warmer temperatures than in past years. We hypothesize that the differences in response to changing environmental conditions between these species arise from differences in their migration patterns and early life histories. Shad spawn soon after they enter the river in its main stem where environmental conditions of the larvae will closely mirror those experienced by upstream-migrating adults. They may therefore have evolved a migratory pattern that allows greater behavioral response to environmental fluctuations than sockeye salmon, which spawn in distant locations many months after their upriver migration. Sockeye salmon migration may be more strongly controlled by innate responses to photoperiod, migrating at the time of year which is best on average because conditions in the lower river will not be indicative of those to be experienced by incubating embryos and juveniles.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing with aircraft-based sensors can provide the fine resolution required for site-specific farming. The within-field spatial distribution of some soil properties was found by using multiple linear regression to select the best combinations of wave bands, taken from among a full set of 60 narrow bands in the wavelength range of 429 to 1010 nm. The resulting regression equations made it possible to calculate the value of the soil property at every pixel, with a spatial resolution of 1.2 m. Both surface and subsurface samples of soil were taken from the center of each of 321 equal-sized grids on 128 ha of recently seeded and nearly bare soil. The soil samples were tested in a laboratory for 15 different properties. The percent sand in surface samples was found to be detectable with a reasonable degree of accuracy with R-2 = 0.806 for a four-parameter model; the best combination of wavelengths was 627, 647, 724, and 840 nm. For silt, clay, chlorides, electrical conductivity, and phosphorous, the results were somewhat less satisfactory with a range of 0.66 {\textless} R-2 {\textless} 0.76. The poorest fit was for carbon with R-2 = 0.27. Organic matter and saturation percentage had R-2 {\textless} 0.49. For the remaining properties, i.e., {pH}, Ca, Mg, Na, K, and bicarbonates, the correlation was intermediate and statistically significant, but with a great deal of scatter around the regression lines. An example of an image map was produced showing the percent sand at every pixel location in one field. New spectral indices were developed; one index (I = R-763 - {0.85*R-753} - {0.24*R-657} - {0.40*R-443)} was found to work well with five of the soil properties ({EC}, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl), indicating some commonality in the manner in which they affected the reflectance from the soil surface, possibly due to a salinity effect. Multiple linear regressions were also run on every possible combination of four broader bands in the blue, green, red, and near-infrared regions of the spectrum, resulting in R2 values lower than with the various combinations of narrow bands. The main findings were that (1) some soil properties can be accurately detected using airborne remote sensing over nearly bare fields, and (2) it is possible to produce a fine-resolution, farm-size, soils map showing the in-field distribution of these properties.},

	abstract = {We explore a strategy for long-range hydrologic forecasting that uses ensemble climate model forecasts as input to a macroscale hydrologic model to produce runoff and streamflow forecasts at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for water management. Monthly ensemble climate model forecasts produced by the National Centers for Environmental {Prediction/Climate} Prediction Center global spectral model ({GSM)} are bias corrected, downscaled to 1/8 horizontal resolution, and disaggregated to a daily time step for input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrologic model. Bias correction is effected by evaluating the {GSM} ensemble forecast variables as percentiles relative to the {GSM} model climatology and then extracting the percentiles' associated variable values instead from the observed climatology. The monthly meteorological forecasts are then interpolated to the finer hydrologic model scale, at which a daily signal that preserves the forecast anomaly is imposed through resampling of the historic record. With the resulting monthly runoff and streamflow forecasts for the East Coast and Ohio River basin, we evaluate the bias correction and resampling approaches during the southeastern United States drought from May to August 2000 and also for the El NiÃ±o conditions of December 1997 to February 1998. For the summer 2000 study period, persistence in anomalous initial hydrologic states predominates in determining the hydrologic forecasts. In contrast, the El NiÃ±o-condition hydrologic forecasts derive direction both from the climate model forecast signal and the antecedent land surface state. From a qualitative standpoint the hydrologic forecasting strategy appears successful in translating climate forecast signals to hydrologic variables of interest for water management.

	abstract = {1. Despite escalating conflict over fresh water, recent years have witnessed a growing realisation that human society must modify its behaviour to ensure long-term ecological vitality of riverine ecosystems. In response, ecologists have been increasingly asked to guide instream flow management by providing 'environmental flow' prescriptions for sustaining the ecological integrity of riverine systems. 2. Environmental flows are typically discussed in the context of water releases from dams and water allocation for extraction ( such as for urban use or irrigation), where there is general agreement that rivers need to exhibit some resemblance of natural flow variability necessary to support a functioning ecosystem. Although productive dialogue continues on how best to define environmental flows, these discussions have been focused primarily on water quantity without explicit consideration of many components of water quality, including water temperature - a fundamental ecological variable. 3. Many human activities on the landscape have modified riverine thermal regimes. In particular, many dams have modified thermal regimes by selectively releasing hypolimnetic ( cold) or epilimnetic ( warm) water from thermally stratified reservoirs to the detriment of entire assemblages of native organisms. Despite the global scope of thermal alteration by dams, the prevention or mitigation of thermal degradation has not entered the conversation when environmental flows are discussed. 4. Here, we propose that a river's thermal regime is a key, yet poorly acknowledged, component of environmental flows. This study explores the concept of the natural thermal regime, reviews how dam operations modify thermal regimes, and discusses the ecological implications of thermal alteration for freshwater ecosystems. We identify five major challenges for incorporating water temperatures into environmental flow assessments, and describe future research opportunities and some alternative approaches for confronting those challenges. 5. We encourage ecologists and water managers to broaden their perspective on environmental flows to include both water quantity and quality with respect to restoring natural thermal regimes. We suggest that scientific research should focus on the comprehensive characterisation of seasonality and variability in stream temperatures, quantification of the temporal and spatial impacts of dam operations on thermal regimes and clearer elucidation of the relative roles of altered flow and temperature in shaping ecological patterns and processes in riverine ecosystems. Future investigations should also concentrate on using this acquired knowledge to identify the 'manageable' components of the thermal regime, and develop optimisation models that evaluate management trade-offs and provide a range of optimal environmental flows that meet both ecosystem and human needs for fresh water.},

Watershed residents helped develop four scenarios to evaluate alternative future trends in agricultural management and to project potential economic and environmental outcomes. We found that environmental and economic benefits can be attained through changes in agricultural land management without increasing public costs. The magnitude of these benefits depends on the magnitude of changes to agricultural practices. Environmental benefits include improved water quality, healthier fish, increased carbon sequestration, and decreased greenhouse gas emissions, while economic benefits include social capital formation, greater farm profitability, and avoided costs. Policy transitions that emphasize functions of agriculture in addition to food production are crucial for creating change. We suggest that redirecting farm payments by using alternative incentives could lead to substantial environmental changes at little or no extra cost to the taxpayer.},

Systematic conservation planning typically only takes a small piece of this complex puzzle into account. Here, we use a return-on-investment ({ROI)} approach to prioritise lands for conservation at the county level in the conterminous {USA.} Our approach accounts for species richness, county area, the proportion of species' ranges already protected, the threat of land conversion and land costs. Areas selected by a complementarity-based greedy heuristic using our full {ROI} approach provided greater averted species losses per dollar spent compared with areas selected by heuristics accounting for richness alone or richness and cost, and avoided acquiring lands not threatened with conversion. In contrast to traditional prioritisation approaches, our results highlight conservation bargains, opportunities to avert the threat of development and places where conservation efforts are currently lacking.},

	abstract = {Regional climates are a major factor in determining the distribution of many species. Anthropogenic inputs of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere have been predicted to cause rapid climatic changes in the next 50-100 years. Species such as the Gila trout (Oncorhynchus gilae) that have small ranges, limited dispersal capabilities, and narrow physiological tolerances will become increasingly susceptible to extinction as their climate envelope changes. This study uses a regional climate change simulation (Leung et al., Clim Change 62:75-113, 2004) to determine changes in the climate envelope for Gila trout, which is sensitive to maximum temperature, associated with a plausible scenario for greenhouse gas increases. These regional climate changes are downscaled to derive surface temperature lapse rates using regression models. This procedure indicates that suitable, warm season habitat for Gila trout will be reduced by 70\% by decreasing the size of their climate envelope. Warmer temperatures coupled with a decrease in summer precipitation would also tend to increase the intensity and frequency of forest fires that are a major threat to their survival. The climate envelope approach utilized here could be used to assess climate change threats to other rare species with limited ranges and dispersal capabilities.},

Gravimetric proportions of fish, crayfish, and other prey consumed by each predator in spring and summer differed among the three river reaches for each predator species. Fish prey were generally the largest dietary component for all three predator species, although crayfish were also prevalent in the diets of smallmouth bass and, to a lesser extent, northern pikeminnow. Numerical proportions of salmonids, cottids, and other fish prey differed among predator species and among study reaches. Juvenile salmonids formed the majority of fish prey consumed by northern pikeminnow, whereas cottids, cyprinids, catostomids, and percopsids were more commonly consumed by smallmouth bass and walleyes. Weight of juvenile salmonids consumed by smallmouth bass and northern pikeminnow varied among years, but did not increase from 1990 to 1996. Back-calculated lengths of consumed prey fish often differed among predator species, and maximum length of consumed salmonids and sculpins was linearly related to smallmouth bass and northern pikeminnow length. Daily rations and numerical salmonid consumption rates differed among river reaches, and consumption of nonsalmonids by smallmouth bass was much greater than that of northern pikeminnow. This study clarified predator-prey relationships between indigenous and introduced predator and prey species in the lower Columbia and lower Snake rivers.},

Maximum stream temperatures increased 7 {degreesC} and occurred earlier in the summer after clear-cutting and burning in one basin and after debris flows and patch-cutting in another. Diurnal fluctuations in June increased from approximately 2 to 8 {degreesC.} Stream temperatures in both basins gradually returned to preharvest levels after 15 years. The influence of the primary factor controlling stream temperatures, shortwave solar radiation, was amplified following removal of riparian vegetation, and conduction between stream water and nearby soils or substrates also appeared to be an important factor.

Models are developed using sample data collected between 1993 and 1997 from 149 wadeable streams in the basin. Model uncertainties are propagated through model projections and into aggregated estimates of regional status. The projections show no significant change in basin-wide status in year 2050, relative to Circa 1990, for scenarios either of increased human development or continuation of current development trends, because landscape change under these scenarios is dominated by conversion of agricultural land to rural residential and urban uses, and because these changes affect only a small percentage of the basin. However, under a scenario of increased conservation, regional medians of biotic status indicators are projected to improve by 9-24\% by year 2050. None of the changes projected between Circa 1990 and year 2050 is as large in magnitude as the decline in status projected to have occurred between the time of pre-European settlement and Circa 1990.},

The thermal regime of rivers plays an important role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems, including water quality issues and the distribution of aquatic species within the river environment. Consequently, for conducting environmental impact assessments as well as for effective fisheries management, it is important to understand the thermal behaviour of rivers and related heat exchange processes. 2. This study reviews the different river thermal processes responsible for water temperature variability on both the temporal (e.g. diel, daily, seasonal) and spatial scales, as well as providing information related to different water temperature models currently found in the literature. 3. Water temperature models are generally classified into three groups: regression, stochastic and deterministic models. Deterministic models employ an energy budget approach to predict river water temperature, whereas regression and stochastic models generally rely on air to water temperature relationships. 4. Water temperature variability can occur naturally or as a result of anthropogenic perturbations, such as thermal pollution, deforestation, flow modification and climate change. Literature information is provided on the thermal regime of rivers in relation to anthropogenic impacts and such information will contribute to the better protection of fish habitat and more efficient fisheries management.},

Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance ({IBR)} model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species' range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The {IBR} model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change.},

	abstract = {Soil erosion by water ({WSE)} has become a relevant issue at the Mediterranean level. In particular, natural conditions and human impact have made the Calabria (southern Italy) particularly prone to intense {WSE.} The purpose of this investigation is to identify areas highly affected by {WSE} in Calabria by comparing the scenarios obtained by assuming control and preventive measures and actions, as well as actual conditions generated by forest fires, also in the presence of conditions of maximum rainfall erosion. Geographic Information System techniques have been adopted to treat data of reasonable spatial resolution obtained at a regional scale for application to the {RUSLE} model. This work is based on the comparison of such data with a basic scenario that has been defined by the present situation (present scenario). In this scenario: (i) R has been assessed by means of an experimental relation adjusted to Calabria on the basis of 5-min observations; (ii) K has been drawn from the soil map of Calabria including 160 soilscapes; (iii) {LS} has been estimated according to the {RUSLE2} model by using (among other subfactors) a 40-m square cell {DTM;} (iv) C has been derived by processing the data inferred from the project Corine Land Cover, whose legend includes 35 different land uses on three levels; and (v) P has been hypothesized as equal to 1. For the remaining three hypothesized scenarios, the {RUSLE} factors have been adjusted according to experimental data and to data in the literature. In particular, forest areas subject to fire have been randomly generated as far as fire location, extension, structure, and intensity are concerned. The values obtained by the application of the {RUSLE} model have emphasized that land management by means of measures and actions for reducing {WSE} causes a notable reduction of the erosive rate decreasing from similar to 30 to 12.3 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). On the other hand, variations induced by hypothetical wildfires in forests on 10\% of the regional territory bring {WSE} over the whole region to values varying from 30 to 116 Mg ha(-1) y(-1). This study can be offered to territorial planning authorities as an evaluation instrument as it highlights the merits and limitations of some territorial management actions. In fact, in Calabria no observations exist concerning the implications of these actions. (C) 2009 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

We summarize the likely impacts of climate change on the physical environment of salmon in the Pacific Northwest and discuss the potential evolutionary consequences of these changes, with particular reference to Columbia River Basin spring/summer Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon. We discuss the possible evolutionary responses in migration and spawning date egg and juvenile growth and development rates, thermal tolerance, and disease resistance. We know little about ocean migration pathways, so cannot confidently suggest the potential changes in this life stage. Climate change might produce conflicting selection pressures in different life stages, which will interact with plastic (i. e. nongenetic) changes in various ways. To clarify these interactions, we present a conceptual model of how changing environmental conditions shift phenotypic optima and, through plastic responses, phenotype distributions, affecting the force of selection. Our predictions are tentative because we lack data on the strength of selection, heritability, and ecological and genetic linkages among many of the traits discussed here. Despite the challenges involved in experimental manipulation of species with complex life histories, such research is essential for full appreciation of the biological effects of climate change.},

We investigated the effectiveness of thermal remote sensing for analyzing spatial patterns of stream temperature and assessed habitat selection by spring chinook salmon, evaluating whether thermal refugia might be responsible for the persistence of these stocks in rivers where water temperatures frequently exceed their upper tolerance levels (25 degrees C) during spawning migration. By presenting stream temperature and the ecology of chinook salmon in a historical context, we could evaluate how changes in riverine habitat and thermal spatial structure, which can be caused by landuse practices, may influence distributional patterns of chinook salmon. Thermal remote sensing provided spatially continuous maps of stream temperature for reaches used by chinook salmon in the upper subbasins of the Middle Fork and North Fork John Day River. Electivity analysis and logistic regression were used to test for associations between the longitudinal distribution of salmon and cool-water areas and stream habitat characteristics. Chinook salmon were distributed nonuniformly in reaches throughout each stream. Salmon distribution and cool water temperature patterns were most strongly related at reach-level spatial scales in the warm stream, the Middle Fork (maximum likelihood ratio: P {\textless} 0.01), and most weakly related in the cold stream, the North Fork (P {\textgreater} 0.30). Pools were preferred by adult chinook salmon in both subbasins (Bonferroni confidence interval: P less than or equal to 0.05); however, riffles were used proportionately more frequently in the North Fork than in the Middle Fork. Our observations of thermal refugia and their use by chinook salmon at multiple spatial scales reveal that, although heterogeneity in the longitudinal stream temperature profile may be viewed as an ecological warning sign, thermal patchiness in streams also should be recognized for its biological potential to provide habitat for species existing at the margin of their environmental tolerances.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10750-010-0204-0},
	abstract = {Brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) is a sentinel fish species which requires clean, cold water habitats. As such, many jurisdictions in the United States where brook charr are present use this species as an indicator of ecosystem health. In Michigan, groundwater-dominated streams are currently being impacted by increased groundwater withdrawal and land use/land cover changes which alter stream temperatures and their flow, and thus have the potential to significantly influence brook charr production and behavior. We quantified the influence of groundwater withdrawal and land use alteration on thermal habitat availability for brook charr using a groundwater modeling tool that estimated changes in baseflow to a stream segment based on changes to the groundwater system due to groundwater withdrawal and changes in rates of recharge related to landscape changes within a watershed. Projected stream temperature changes were calculated using a stream temperature modeling tool and compared to the range of temperature preferenda for brook charr in order to evaluate the potential impact of policy decisions regarding water extraction and land use/cover changes. The models predicted relatively small changes in both stream baseflow and consequently, stream temperature, with increased groundwater withdrawal rates. Land use/land cover alterations which we analyzed were shown to either mitigate or enhance the loss of brook charr thermal habitat as a result of groundwater withdrawal, depending on its relationship to recharge dynamics. This study emphasizes the importance of collaboration between water, land, and fisheries managers to ensure brook charr population viability, productivity, and sustainability in the face of environmental change, increasing water use and development in the watershed.},

These efforts are complicated by underlying density-dependent processes and the differential responses of predators and their prey to changing climate. We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date. These results highlight the complexity of ecological responses to changing climate and suggest that climate warming may enhance growing conditions for juvenile salmonids in large lakes of Alaska.},

	abstract = {To better understand the spatial dynamics of non-point source ({NPS)} phosphorus loading with soil property at watershed scale, integrated modeling and soil chemistry is crucial to ensure that the indicator is functioning properly and expressing the spatial interaction at two depths. Developments in distributed modeling have greatly enriched the availability of geospatial data analysis and assess the {NPS} pollution loading response to soil property over larger area. The 1.5 km-grid soil sampling at two depths was analyzed with eight parameters, which provided detailed spatial and vertical soil data under four main types of landuses. The impacts of landuse conversion and agricultural practice on soil property were firstly identified. Except for the slightly bigger total of potassium ({TK)} and cadmium (Cr), the other six parameters had larger content in 20-40 cm surface than the top 20 cm surface. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool was employed to simulate the loading of {NPS} phosphorus. Overlaying with the landuse distribution, it was found that the {NPS} phosphorus mainly comes from the subbasins dominated with upland and paddy rice. The linear correlations of eight soil parameters at two depths with {NPS} phosphorus loading in the subbasins of upland and paddy rice were compared, respectively. The correlations of available phosphorus ({AP)}, total phosphorus ({TP)}, total nitrogen ({TN)} and {TK} varied in two depths, and also can assess the loading. The soil with lower soil organic carbon ({SOC)} presented a significant higher risk for {NPS} phosphorus loading, especially in agricultural area. The Principal Component Analysis showed that the {TP} and zinc (Zn) in top soil and copper (Cu) and Cr in subsurface can work as indicators. The analysis suggested that the application of soil property indicators is useful for assessing {NPS} phosphorus loss, which is promising for water safety in agricultural area.

	abstract = {Abstract: Climate change will likely have profound effects on cold-water species of freshwater fishes. As temperatures rise, cold-water fish distributions may shift and contract in response. Predicting the effects of projected stream warming in stream networks is complicated by the generally poor correlation between water temperature and air temperature. Spatial dependencies in stream networks are complex because the geography of stream processes is governed by dimensions of flow direction and network structure. Therefore, forecasting climate-driven range shifts of stream biota has lagged behind similar terrestrial modeling efforts. We predicted climate-induced changes in summer thermal habitat for 3 cold-water fish speciesâjuvenile Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and bull trout (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. mykiss, and Salvelinus confluentus, respectively)âin the John Day River basin, northwestern United States. We used a spatially explicit statistical model designed to predict water temperature in stream networks on the basis of flow and spatial connectivity. The spatial distribution of stream temperature extremes during summers from 1993 through 2009 was largely governed by solar radiation and interannual extremes of air temperature. For a moderate climate change scenario, estimated declines by 2100 in the volume of habitat for Chinook salmon, rainbow trout, and bull trout were 69â95\%, 51â87\%, and 86â100\%, respectively. Although some restoration strategies may be able to offset these projected effects, such forecasts point to how and where restoration and management efforts might focus.},

	abstract = {Most freshwater processes are closely coupled with landscape processes. For example, stream temperature is often dependent on riparian cover and stream flow is mostly dependent on spatiotemporal patterns of rainfall events. In order to characterize stream processes, we must first characterize the surrounding landscape. {GIS} tools have greatly improved our ability to automate this process; however the tools are only accessible to those with advanced programming skills and access to specialized software. Therefore, there is a need for a database of stream and lake attributes that is readily available for use by scientists, policymakers, and the general public. {EPA} recently released {NHDPlus} to fulfill this need, however this product has many limitations, including its scale (1:100,000), and the omission of lakes. Here, we present a database of high resolution (1:24,000 scale based on 10-meter digital elevation model) freshwater attributes for the state of Wisconsin. Over 160,000 streams and lakes were characterized with attributes such as land cover (The National Land Cover Dataset), climate ({PRISM} temperature and precipitation), and geology (e.g., bedrock geology and soil depth). For each attribute, we characterized each freshwater feature across 5 dimensions: the stream/lake level, the immediate riparian area, the cumulative upstream riparian area, the immediate watershed, and the cumulative upstream watershed. We also included attribution for feature connectivity, such as the distance to the nearest lake or large river. The scale of the delineation of each level is a substantial improvement on {NHDPlus.} Within the state of Wisconsin, the average {NHDPlus} watershed size is 2.9 sq. km. ({SD} = 5.6 sq. km.), whereas the average watershed in this database is 0.9 sq. km. ({SD} = 3.1 sq. km.). {NHDPlus} watersheds were delineated based on stream features drawn from 1:100,000-scale digitized maps using a 30-meter {DEM}, whereas watersheds in this database were delineated based on 1:24,000-scale digitized maps using a 10-meter {DEM.} Access to a database with this level of detail will greatly increase the quality and efficiency at which scientists and managers can answer questions and formulate policy for freshwater issues that are dependent on landscape drivers.},

	abstract = {With the widespread decline and endangerment of freshwater fishes, there is a need to clearly define habitat requirements for effective species management and habitat restoration. Fish biologists often infer habitat requirements on the basis of correlative habitat associations in the wild. This generates descriptive models that predict species presence or abundance at a hierarchy of scales: distributional (macrohabitat) models predict the presence/absence of species at large scales, capacity models predict the abundance at the reach or channel unit scale when a species is present, and microhabitat models predict the distribution of individual fish at smaller spatial scales (e.g., instream habitat suitability Curves for velocity, depth, and substrate). However, relationships based on habitat associations in the wild rarely give definitive insight into the absolute requirement for a particular habitat (i.e.. necessity of a habitat for the persistence of individuals and Populations). The assumption that habitat selection accurately reflects the fitness consequences of habitat use is rarely validated; more rigorous assessment of habitat requirement Usually involves manipulative experiments or measurements of fitness (individual growth, survival. or reproductive Success) in different habitat types. Bioenergetic habitat models offer a promising mechanistic alternative to correlative habitat suitability models for drift-feeding, fish and have the potential to predict habitat-specific growth rates on the basis of swimming costs and energy intake. Once smaller-scale habitat requirements of individuals ire well defined, the final step is to determine when and how the requirements of individuals limit populations. Extrapolating smaller-scale habitat requirements to the Population level requires either large-scale (ecosystem) manipulations of habitat, adaptive management, or habitat-explicit population models. For species with distinct ontogenic shifts in habitat requirements, the concept of optimal habitat ratios may be useful for identifying limiting habitat factors and defining baselines for habitat restoration. Defining, optimal habitat configurations for different species may also provide a basis for predicting how habitat change differentially affects species with contrasting habitat needs.},

	abstract = {Predicting how climate change is likely to interact with myriad other stressors that threaten species of conservation concern is an essential challenge in aquatic ecosystems.  This study provides a framework to accomplish this task in salmon-bearing streams of the northwestern United States, where land-use related reductions in riparian shading have caused changes in stream thermal regimes, and additional warming from projected climate change may result in significant losses of coldwater fish habitat over the next century.  Predatory non-native smallmouth bass have also been introduced into many northwestern streams and their range is likely to expand as streams warm, presenting an additional challenge to the persistence of threatened Pacific salmon.  The goal of this work was to forecast the interactive effects of climate change, riparian management, and non-native species on stream-rearing salmon, and to evaluate the capacity of restoration to mitigate these effects.  We intersected downscaled global climate forecasts with a local-scale water temperature model to predict mid- and end-of-century temperatures in streams in the Columbia River basin; we compared one stream that is thermally impaired due to the loss of riparian vegetation and another that is cooler and has a largely intact riparian corridor.  Using the forecasted stream temperatures in conjunction with fish-habitat models, we predicted how stream-rearing Chinook salmon and bass distributions would change as each stream warmed.  In the highly modified stream, end-of-century warming may cause near total loss of Chinook salmon rearing habitat and a complete invasion of the upper watershed by bass.  In the less modified stream, bass were thermally restricted from the upstream-most areas.  In both systems, temperature increases resulted in higher predicted spatial overlap between stream-rearing Chinook salmon and potentially predatory bass in the early summer (2-4-fold increase) and greater abundance of bass.  We found that riparian restoration could prevent the extirpation of Chinook salmon from the more altered stream, and could also restrict bass from occupying the upper 31 km of salmon rearing habitat.  The proposed methodology and model predictions are critical for prioritizing climate-change adaptation strategies before salmonids are exposed to both warmer water and greater predation risk by non-native species.},

	abstract = {Temperature observations at 25 sites in the 2000 km(2) Dee catchment in {NE} Scotland were used, in conjunction with geographic information system ({GIS)} analysis, to identify dominant landscape controls on mean monthly maximum stream temperatures. Maximum winter stream temperatures are mainly controlled by elevation, catchment area and hill shading, whereas the maximum temperatures in summer are driven by more complex interactions, which include the influence of riparian forest cover and distance to coast. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the catchment-wide distribution of mean weekly maximum stream temperatures for the hottest week of the 2-year observation period. The results suggested the streams most sensitive to high temperatures are small upland streams at exposed locations without any forest cover and relatively far inland, while lowland streams with riparian forest cover at locations closer to the coast exhibit a moderated thermal regime. Under current conditions, all streams provide a suitable thermal habitat for both, Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Using two climate change scenarios assuming 2.5 and 4 degrees C air temperature increases, respectively, temperature-sensitive zones of the stream network were identified, which could potentially have an adverse effect on the thermal habitat of Atlantic salmon and brown trout. Analysis showed that the extension of riparian forests into headwater streams has the potential to moderate changes in temperature under climate change. Copyright. (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Determining which portions of agricultural landscapes are major sources of pollution within a watershed is time consuming and labor intensive. Small critical areas of the landscape contribute disproportionate amounts of sediment and phosphorus to nearby waterways. Critical areas are defined here as areas of accumulated overland runoff that are hydrologically connected to surface waters. With advancements in light detection and ranging ({LiDAR)} technologies, landscape topography can be represented with highly accurate terrain data. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using {LiDAR} based terrain attributes to identify fine-scale critical areas in selected Minnesota watersheds and to analyze cost efficiency of this type of analysis. The {LiDAR} digital elevation model data were acquired for two south central Minnesota watersheds, and the terrain attributes slope, flow accumulation, and stream power index were calculated with a 3 m (9.8 ft) spatial resolution. Field surveys were conducted in these watersheds along the riparian corridor to identify side inlets and active gullies that contribute to surface water quality {degradation.Terrain} attributes were able to identify 80\% of field-verified gullies in the study watersheds. Furthermore, an even higher percentage of gullies with a high sediment delivery potential were identified using terrain attributes. Gully size was ranked during field surveys, and 31 of the 32 largest gullies ranked in the field were successfully identified with {LiDAR} based terrain attributes. In contrast, only 7 of these gullies could be identified using 30 m (98 ft) digital elevation model terrain {attributes.The} {LiDAR} approach for identifying critical source areas using terrain attributes has a large potential for cost savings relative to time-consuming field surveys. With an ever-increasing availability of {LiDAR} data, terrain analysis may prove very useful in the future for targeting best management practices to critical areas for reductions in nonpoint source pollution.},

Growth of dominant steelhead in water 20-{23degreesC} was reduced by more than 50\% in trials with Sacramento pikeminnow compared with trials with steelhead alone. Comparison of the two-species treatment with one with an equal density of fish comprised of steelhead alone indicated that the per capita effect of Sacramento pikeminnow was similar to the intraspecific effect of steethead in water 20-{23degreesC.} In contrast, the growth of dominant steelhead in water 15-{18degreesC} was unaffected by Sacramento pikeminnow. The temperature-dependence of the effect of Sacramento pikeminnow on dominant steelhead was also reflected in the size of the area defended by steelhead and in the behavior of Sacramento pikeminnow under the two thermal regimes. Compared with all other treatment combinations, dominant steelhead defended the smallest areas when accompanied by Sacramento pikeminnow in warm water. Behavioral interactions with steelhead initiated by Sacramento pikeminnow were about 50 times more frequent in warm water. For the growth of subdominant steelhead, the effect of intraspecific competition exceeded the interspecific effect of Sacramento pikeminnow regardless of water temperature. While thermal regime affects the distributions of these two species, this experiment suggests that it also affects the outcome of competition between them.},

Although local and basin- scale differences in riverine fish diversity have been analysed as functions of energy availability and habitat heterogeneity(2), scale- dependent environmental conditions(3) and river discharge(4,5), a model that predicts a comprehensive set of system-wide diversity patterns has been hard to find. Here we show that fish diversity patterns throughout the Mississippi - Missouri River System are well described by a neutral metacommunity model coupled with an appropriate habitat capacity distribution and dispersal kernel. River network structure acts as an effective template for characterizing spatial attributes of fish biodiversity. We show that estimates of average dispersal behaviour and habitat capacities, objectively calculated from average runoff production, yield reliable predictions of large- scale spatial biodiversity patterns in riverine systems. The success of the neutral theory in two- dimensional forest ecosystems(6-8) and here in dendritic riverine ecosystems suggests the possible application of neutral metacommunity models in a diverse suite of ecosystems. This framework offers direct linkage from large- scale forcing, such as global climate change, to biodiversity patterns.},

	abstract = {1. Climate change has been inducing range shifts for many species as they follow their suitable climate space and further shifts are projected. Whether species will be able to colonize regions where climate conditions become suitable, so-called 'new climate space', depends on species traits and habitat fragmentation. 2. By combining bioclimate envelope models with dispersal models, we identified areas where the spatial cohesion of the ecosystem pattern is expected to be insufficient to allow colonization of new climate space. 3. For each of three ecosystem types, three species were selected that showed a shift in suitable climate space and differed in habitat fragmentation sensitivity. 4. For the 2020 and 2050 time slices, the amount of climatically suitable habitat in northwest Europe diminished for all studied species. Additionally, significant portions of new suitable habitat could not be colonized because of isolation. Together, this will result in a decline in the amount of suitable habitat protected in Natura 2000 sites. 5. We develop several adaptation strategies to combat this problem: (i) link isolated habitat that is within a new suitable climate zone to the nearest climate-proof network; (ii) increase colonizing capacity in the overlap zone, the part of a network that remains suitable in successive time frames; (iii) optimize sustainable networks in climate refugia, the part of a species' range where the climate remains stable. 6. Synthesis and applications. Following the method described in this study, we can identify those sites across Europe where ecosystem patterns are not cohesive enough to accommodate species' responses to climate change. The best locations for climate corridors where improving connectivity is most urgent and potential gain is highest can then be pinpointed.},

The abundance changes of the combined stocks can be separated into productivity regimes that correspond to changes in climate trends. The most distinct change occurred when there was a major change in the climate over the Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976-1977. The existence of natural shifts in abundance trends means that the high returns that occur during periods of high productivity would not be expected to occur during the low-productivity periods. The response of Fraser River sockeye to climate changes may be a specific example of a more general response by a number of species of fishes in the Pacific and perhaps in other oceans. Because the shift from one regime to the other occurred quickly in the 1970s, future shifts could also occur quickly. It is necessary to detect natural shifts in productivity when attempting to manage fishing impacts to ensure that economic expectations are sound and that overfishing does not occur.},

During 1933-1996, oceanic, coastal, and freshwater indices of climate were highly correlated, and an index for the Columbia River Basin suggested that climate shifts may have occurred about 1946, 1958, 1969, and 1977. Summer water temperature varied as much as 2 {degreesC} between climate periods. We used a bioenergetics model for northern squawfish, the most important piscivore, to predict that predation on salmonids would have been 26-31\% higher during two periods with relatively warm spring-summer water temperatures (1933-1946, 1978-1996) than during an extremely cold period (1947-1958). Predicted predation rates of northern squawfish were 68-96\% higher in the warmest year compared with the coldest year. Predation rates of smallmouth bass and walleye on juvenile salmonids varied among climate periods similar to rates predicted for northern squawfish. Climatic effects need to be understood in both freshwater and nearshore marine habitats, since growth rates of salmon populations are especially sensitive to mortality during early life stages.},

Population data were analysed at the North Sea scale (years 1983 to 1999) and at the regional scale (southwestern section and northeastern section; years 1984 to 1996/7). Relationships between recruitment and spawning stock biomass were weak, but Age-1 sandeels (non-spawners) were related negatively with recruitment, implying that demographic effects are important. A negative relationship was detected between recruitment and the winter index of the North Atlantic Oscillation, which affects sea temperatures during the egg and larval period. Warmer sea temperatures correlated with poorer than average recruitment. This effect was most pronounced in the southwestern part of the North Sea, which is near the southern limit of the species' distribution. There was a positive association between recruitment and Calanus copepod (Stages V and {VI)} abundance around the time of larval hatching, suggesting that the availability of this prey species is important for young sandeel survival.

This method combines the interpolation of daily ratios/fractions derived from ground-based meteorological station records and respective fields of monthly estimates.

The results of this study show that this nonconventional interpolation preserves the spatial and temporal distribution of both the {PRISM} maps (monthly, topography-sensitive patterns) and the original daily observations. Statistics of a preliminary point comparison with the observed values at high-quality and independent reference sites show a reasonable agreement and a noticeable improvement over the nearest station method in orographically sensitive areas. The implemented datasets provide daily precipitation and temperature values at 2.5-min (around 4 km) resolution for 1960-2001.

Contrary to predictions, from 28 to 60\% of marked fish moved at least one habitat unit, and immigration of unmarked fish also indicated considerable movement. Upstream movement predominated but the stream with the step-pool/cascade channel type had fewer upstream movers and greater distances moved downstream. Coho movers were not smaller than nonmovers, as predicted based on assumptions that movement results from competitive exclusion. Habitat units that coho left were smaller and shallower but lower in density than units where coho remained. Thus, movement is a common phenomenon rather than an aberration, and may reflect habitat choice rather than territorial eviction. Moreover, movers grew faster than nonmovers, so the \&quot;mobile fraction\&quot; of the population was not composed of competitively inferior fish but rather individuals that thrived. The phenomenon of small-scale habitat- and growth-related movements should be considered when planning and interpreting studies of juvenile salmonid ecology in streams.},

They have been implemented by {TNC} in more than 30 ecoregions across the {U.S.}, and work is expanding to include other parts of the Americas. The tools are now in their second iteration. While the first version of the tools worked only with the {RF3} hydrography dataset available in the {U.S.}, the second version is more flexible and will function with a variety of datasets. Future improvements in the tools could include an improved interface and improved algorithms to reduce data pre-processing needs.

Because the saturation vapour pressure of water in air is highly sensitive to temperature, perturbations in the global water cycle are expected to accompany climate warming(6). Regional patterns of warming-induced changes in surface hydroclimate are complex and less certain than those in temperature, however, with both regional increases and decreases expected in precipitation and runoff. Here we show that an ensemble of 12 climate models exhibits qualitative and statistically significant skill in simulating observed regional patterns of twentieth-century multidecadal changes in streamflow. These models project 10-40\% increases in runoff in eastern equatorial Africa, the La Plata basin and high-latitude North America and Eurasia, and 10-30\% decreases in runoff in southern Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East and mid-latitude western North America by the year 2050. Such changes in sustainable water availability would have considerable regional-scale consequences for economies as well as ecosystems.},

The {MNSTREM} model has been expanded to include heat flux between streambed and water. The model is sensitive to each of the weather and streambed parameters to different degrees. Sensitivity coefficients represent the change in stream water temperature resulting from a unit change in each of the model parameters. They are calculated by two methods that give same order of magnitude results. To establish the sensitivity of the model to each parameter the mean and/or the standard deviations of each of the weather and streambed parameters is multiplied by its sensitivity coefficient. The sensitivity analysis gives quantitative evidence that stream water temperature is more sensitive to air temperature and solar radiation than to other weather and bed parameters. It also shows quantitatively that daily-average stream water temperatures are not very sensitive to the streambed thermal conductivity.},

	abstract = {Declines in brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) throughout its historic eastern United States of America ({U.S.)} range prompted the formation of the Eastern Brook Trout [Charr] Joint Venture (Joint Venture) whose mandate is to restore these charr by working cooperatively at a range-wide, regional-scale. Joint Venture habitat projects in the {U.S.} are initiated by local community-based organizations, assisted by fisheries management institutions, and funded through the {U.S.} Fish and Wildlife Service. In order to assist with ranking these community-based proposals for available funding, the Joint Venture designed a quantitative scoring method as a decision support tool that addressed range-wide threats that were documented to limit brook charr production. These threats include habitat modification (e.g., dams, urbanization, and agricultural landuse) and interactions with antagonistic non-native species [i.e., brown trout (Salmo trutta) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)]. This article evaluated the prioritization method used by comparing the quantitative rankings of the proposals with the final reports for 12 completed projects using paired t tests for unequal sample sizes and variance. Two of the 12 comparisons revealed statistically significant differences (P {\textless} 0.05) between project proposals and final reports; namely, the scoring criteria for the proposals did not accurately reflect the outcome of these projects in relation to brook charr management. Large inter-quartile ranges between reviewer scores were common, indicating that the quantitative scoring method includes qualitative elements. In addition to the science-based criteria, subjective value judgments by individual reviewers have factored into the Joint Venture's decision making process. By evaluating the decision support tool, this analysis aims to assist the Joint Venture in structuring its approach to conservation and rehabilitation of brook charr populations in the eastern {U.S.} To better improve the Joint Venture's ability to address brook charr management on a regional level, we recommend that future proposal prioritization scoring criteria provide more explicit guidance for accurate scoring, separate scoring methods for policy and assessment work, and a weighting factor for larger than sub-watershed projects and for scoring criteria for which information is unknown.},

We examined the temperature patterns of two subboreal outlet streams in north-central British Columbia for I year before and 3 years after clearcut logging and found only modest changes (averaging 0.05-{1.1degreesC)} with respect to summer daily maximum and minimum temperatures, diurnal fluctuations, and stream cooling. A multistream comparative survey conducted in the same geographic region revealed that streams headed by small lakes or swamps tended to cool as they flowed downstream, and headwater streams warmed, regardless of whether or not timber harvesting took place. Stream cooling was attributed to a combination of warm outlet temperatures (promoted by the presence of the lakes) and cold groundwater inflows. A regression model revealed that summertime downstream warming or cooling in headwater and outlet streams could be predicted by upstream maximum summer temperatures and canopy cover. Lentic water bodies and groundwater inflows are important determinants of stream temperature patterns in subboreal forests and may subsequently moderate their responses to streamside harvesting.},

	abstract = {Fifty-two drainage lakes, located in south-central Ontario, Canada, were examined to study the association of isolation- and environment-related factors with fish community composition. Eight quantitative measures of lake isolation were examined, each of which incorporated potential ecological "challenges" that a fish encounters when moving between lakes. A Procrustean approach was employed to assess the degree of concordance between fish assemblage structure, measures of lake isolation and environmental conditions (i.e., lake morphology and water chemistry). Our results revealed a high concordance between patterns in fish community composition and lake isolation and lake morphology at the watershed scale, suggesting that insular and habitat-related factors influence the structure of fish communities. At the scale of the individual lake, this relationship varied greatly, ranging from a strong match of community composition with both spatial and abiotic conditions to communities exhibiting weak association with these conditions. Furthermore, we showed that alternative measures of Lake isolation provide additional insight into potential factors shaping patterns in fish community composition; information not provided using straight-line distances between lakes. Finally, the statistical methodology outlined in this paper provides a robust technique for assessing both the overall association between multivariate data matrices (i.e., landscape or regional scale), as well as facilitating the examination of smaller-scale relationships of individual observations (i.e., local scale).},

	abstract = {Conventional methods for soil sampling and analysis for soil variability in chemical characteristics are too time-consuming and expensive for multi-seasonal monitoring over large-scale areas. Hence, the objectives of this study are: 1) to determine changes in chemical concentrations of soils that are amended with treated sewage sludge; and 2) to determine if {LANDSAT} {TM} data can be used to map surface chemical characteristics of such amended soils. For this study, we selected two fields in {NW} Ohio, designated as F34 and F11, that had been applied with 34 and 11 ton acre(-1) of biosolids, respectively. Soil samples from a total of 70 sampling locations across the two fields were collected one day prior to {LANDSAT} 5 overpass and were analyzed for several elemental concentrations. The accumulation of Ba, Cd, Cu, S and P were found to be significantly higher in the surface soils of field F34, compared to field F11. Regression equations were established to search for algorithms that could map these five elemental concentrations in the surface soils using six, dark-object-subtracted ({DOS)} {LANDSAT} {TM} bands and the 15 non-reciprocal spectral ratios derived from these six bands for the May 20,2005, {LANDSAT} 5 {TM} image. Phosphorus (P) had the highest R(2) adjusted value (67.9\%) among all five elements considered, and the resulting algorithm employed only spectral ratios. This model was successfully tested for robustness by applying it to another {LANDSAT} {TM} image obtained on June 5, 2005. Our results enabled us to conclude that {LANDSAT} {TM} imagery of bare-soil fields can be used to quantify and map the spatial variation of total phosphorous concentration in surface soils. This research has significant implications for identification and mapping of areas with high P, which is important for implementing and monitoring the best phosphorous management practices across the region.

	abstract = {A study was conducted on three {U.S.} military training areas to validate the Unit Stream Power Erosion and Deposition ({USPED)} model, a 3-dimensional enhancement to the Universal Soil Loss Equation ({USLE).} The {USPED} model differs from other {USLE-based} models in the manner in which it handles the influence of topography on the erosion process. As a result, the {USPED} model predicts both erosion and deposition, while most other {USLE-based} models are limited to predictions of erosion only. Erosion and deposition from a small watershed at Fort Hood, Texas, {USA} was quantified using Cs-137, a radioactive isotope found in soils around the world as a result of fallout from post-World War {II} nuclear testing. We compared Cs-137-derived erosion/deposition measurements with estimates derived from the {USPED} model and two applications of the {USLE.} Soil erosion and sediment deposition estimates generated by the {USPED} model were more accurate and less biased than results of the {USLE} applications. Both applications of the {USLE} consistently and significantly overestimated soil erosion; the {USPED} model did not. The {USPED} model was subsequently applied to Camp Guernsey, Wyoming, {USA} and Fort {McCoy}, Wisconsin, {USA.} Model estimates of soil erosion and sediment deposition were compared with field estimates of the same parameters. Based on 3 levels of soil erosion and 3 levels of sediment deposition, the model results agreed with field estimates 76 and 89\% of the time at the two locations, respectively.

	abstract = {1.âMethods used to predict shifts in speciesâ ranges because of climate change commonly involve species distribution (niche) modelling using climatic variables, future values of which are predicted for the next several decades by general circulation models. However, speciesâ distributions also depend on factors other than climate, such as land cover, land use and soil type. Changes in some of these factors, such as soil type, occur over geologic time and are thus imperceptible over the timescale of these types of projections. Other factors, such as land use and land cover, are expected to change over shorter timescales, but reliable projections are not available. Some important predictor variables, therefore, must be treated as unchanging, or static, whether because of the properties of the variable or out of necessity. The question of how best to combine dynamic variables predicted by climate models with static variables is not trivial and has been dealt with differently in studies to date. Alternative methods include using the static variables as masks, including them as independent explanatory variables in the model, or excluding them altogether. 2.âUsing a set of simulated species, we tested various methods for combining static variables with future climate scenarios. Our results showed that including static variables in the model with the dynamic variables performed better or no worse than either masking or excluding the static variables. 3.âThe difference in predictive ability was most pronounced when there is an interaction between the static and dynamic variables. 4.âFor variables such as land use, our results indicate that if such variables affect species distributions, including them in the model is better than excluding them, even though this may mean making the unrealistic assumption that the variable will not change in the future. 5.âThese results demonstrate the importance of including static and dynamic non-climate variables in addition to climate variables in species distribution models designed to predict future change in a speciesâ habitat or distribution as a result of climate change.},

Given the many biological scales at which water temperature effects have been studied, and the growing need to integrate knowledge from multiple disciplines of thermal biology to fully protect beneficial uses, we held that a survey of the most promising recent developments and an expression of some of the remaining unanswered questions with significant management implications would best be approached collectively by a diverse research community. We have identified five specific topic areas of renewed research where new techniques and critical thought could benefit coldwater stream fishes (particularly salmonids): molecular, organism, population/ species, community and ecosystem, and policy issues in water quality. Our hope is that information gained through examination of recent research fronts linking knowledge at various scales will prove useful in managing water quality at a basin level to protect fish populations and whole ecosystems. Standards of the past were based largely on incipient lethal and optimum growth rate temperatures for fish species, while future standards should consider all integrated thermal impacts to the organism and ecosystem.},

	abstract = {This study investigated variability and trends in the annual snow-cover cycle in regions covering high-latitude and high-elevation land areas in the Northern Hemisphere. The annual snow-cover cycle was examined with respect to the week of the last-observed snow cover in spring ({WLS)}, the week of the first-observed snow cover in autumn ({WFS)}, and the duration of the snow-free period ({DSF).} The analysis used a 29-year time-series (1972-2000) of weekly, visible-band satellite observations of Northern Hemisphere snow cover from {NOAA} with corrections applied by D. Robinson of Rutgers University Climate Laboratory. Substantial interannual variability was observed in {WLS}, {WFS} and {DSF} (standard deviations of 0.8-1.1, 0.7-0.9 and 1.0-1.4 weeks, respectively), which is related directly to interannual variability in snow-cover area in the regions and time periods of snow-cover transition. Over the nearly three-decade study period, {WLS} shifted earlier by 3-5 days/decade as determined by linear regression analysis. The observed shifts in the annual snow-cover cycle underlie a significant trend toward a longer annual snow-free period. The {DSF} increased by 5-6 days/decade over the study period, primarily as a result of earlier snow cover disappearance in spring. The observed trends are consistent with reported trends in the timing and length of the active growing season as determined from satellite observations of vegetation greenness and the atmospheric {CO2} record.

	volume = {55},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2427.2009.02204.x},
	abstract = {1. The flow regime is a primary determinant of the structure and function of aquatic and riparian ecosystems for streams and rivers. Hydrologic alteration has impaired riverine ecosystems on a global scale, and the pace and intensity of human development greatly exceeds the ability of scientists to assess the effects on a river-by-river basis. Current scientific understanding of hydrologic controls on riverine ecosystems and experience gained from individual river studies support development of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. 2. This paper presents a consensus view from a group of international scientists on a new framework for assessing environmental flow needs for many streams and rivers simultaneously to foster development and implementation of environmental flow standards at the regional scale. This framework, the ecological limits of hydrologic alteration ({ELOHA)}, is a synthesis of a number of existing hydrologic techniques and environmental flow methods that are currently being used to various degrees and that can support comprehensive regional flow management. The flexible approach allows scientists, water-resource managers and stakeholders to analyse and synthesise available scientific information into ecologically based and socially acceptable goals and standards for management of environmental flows. 3. The {ELOHA} framework includes the synthesis of existing hydrologic and ecological databases from many rivers within a user-defined region to develop scientifically defensible and empirically testable relationships between flow alteration and ecological responses. These relationships serve as the basis for the societally driven process of developing regional flow standards. This is to be achieved by first using hydrologic modelling to build a `hydrologic foundation' of baseline and current hydrographs for stream and river segments throughout the region. Second, using a set of ecologically relevant flow variables, river segments within the region are classified into a few distinctive flow regime types that are expected to have different ecological characteristics. These river types can be further subclassified according to important geomorphic features that define hydraulic habitat features. Third, the deviation of current-condition flows from baseline-condition flow is determined. Fourth, flow alteration-ecological response relationships are developed for each river type, based on a combination of existing hydroecological literature, expert knowledge and field studies across gradients of hydrologic alteration. 4. Scientific uncertainty will exist in the flow alteration-ecological response relationships, in part because of the confounding of hydrologic alteration with other important environmental determinants of river ecosystem condition ( e. g. temperature). Application of the {ELOHA} framework should therefore occur in a consensus context where stakeholders and decision-makers explicitly evaluate acceptable risk as a balance between the perceived value of the ecological goals, the economic costs involved and the scientific uncertainties in functional relationships between ecological responses and flow alteration. 5. The {ELOHA} framework also should proceed in an adaptive management context, where collection of monitoring data or targeted field sampling data allows for testing of the proposed flow alteration-ecological response relationships. This empirical validation process allows for a fine-tuning of environmental flow management targets. The {ELOHA} framework can be used both to guide basic research in hydroecology and to further implementation of more comprehensive environmental flow management of freshwater sustainability on a global scale.},

The factors considered are intensity of rainfall, type of soil, land use classification and the existing soil conservation practices. Detailed analysis of soil samples were done to assess the texture, structure, permeability and organic matter content of the soil samples of each hillslope unit. The required data for the other parameters were estimated by carrying out intense field investigations and by the analysis of the satellite imagery of 5.6 m resolution. A data base was created with all the subfactor values for the hillslope units. Incorporation of remote sensing technique and Geographic Information System ({GIS)} made the spatial analysis of the study more reliable and accurate. The annual average soil erosion rate is estimated as 25 t/ha/year, which is on a higher range. This indicates the immediate need for the adoption of proper conservation strategies in this area to control the eutrophication in the Krishnagiri reservoir and to prevent further watershed degradation.},

Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles ( or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial 'sign-switching' responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates 'very high confidence' (as laid down by the {IPCC)} that climate change is already affecting living systems.},

Our results reveal areas with projected high densities of climate-driven movements â including, the Amazon Basin, the southeastern United States and southeastern Brazil. Some of these regions, such as southern Bolivia and northern Paraguay, contain relatively intact landscapes, whereas others such as the southeastern United States and Brazil are heavily impacted by human activities.

	abstract = {River temperature remains a subject of major worldwide research, yet understanding of multi-scale thermal variability across river systems is limited. Such studies are necessary to elucidate the relative importance of site-specific (reach-scale) versus landscape controls. This article addresses this research need by identifying water temperature variability across an alpine river basin, using high-resolution (15 min) water column temperature data at 29 sites in the Taillon-Gabietous basin, French Pyrenees. Thermal patterns were examined in relation to a suite of meteorological (incoming shortwave radiation, air temperature, and precipitation) and basin characteristics (altitude, azimuth, stream length, and stream order). Mean water temperature for the monitoring period varied markedly across the river basin, ranging from 0.4 degrees C at the Taillon Glacier to 14.6 degrees C in a south-facing hillslope groundwater stream. Basin-scale water temperature patterns were strongly influenced by stream water source. Stream temperature was also significantly associated with basin characteristics, most notably altitude, azimuth, and stream length. Thermal heterogeneity across the basin was higher than that along the Taillon Glacier stream, despite rapid longitudinal warming rates with distance from the glacier snout. The timing of thermal extremes (maximum/minimum) during two contrasting hydrometeorological events (hot summer day vs intense hail/rain storm) revealed a clear synchronicity of thermal response among sites, although notable exceptions included karstic groundwater streams that were weakly influenced by concurrent meteorological conditions. Overall, the study demonstrates high thermal heterogeneity at the basin scale (being equal to, or greater than, that found in previous investigations), and the major effect of water source and landscape factors such as altitude, azimuth, and stream length on alpine stream temperature.

Laboratory data available for marine fish and invertebrates from various climatic regions led to the hypothesis that, as a unifying principle, a mismatch between the demand for oxygen and the capacity of oxygen supply to tissues is the first mechanism to restrict whole-animal tolerance to thermal extremes. We show in the eelpout, Zoarces viviparus, a bioindicator fish species for environmental monitoring from North and Baltic Seas (Helcom), that thermally limited oxygen delivery closely matches environmental temperatures beyond which growth performance and abundance decrease. Decrements in aerobic performance in warming seas will thus be the first process to cause extinction or relocation to cooler waters.},

	abstract = {There is an unprecedented need to preserve and restore aquatic and riparian biological diversity before extinction eliminates the opportunity. Ecological restoration is the reestablishment of processes, functions, and related biological, chemical, and physical linkages between the aquatic and associated riparian ecosystems; it is the repairing of damage caused by human activities. The first and most critical step in ecological restoration is passive restoration, the cessation of those anthropogenic activities that are causing degradation or preventing recovery. Given the capacity of riparian ecosystems to naturally recover, often this is all that is needed to achieve successful restoration. Prior to implementation of active restoration approaches (e.g., instream structures, channel and streambank reconfiguration, and planting programs), a period of time sufficient for natural recovery is recommended. Unfortunately, structural additions and active manipulations are frequently undertaken without halting degrading land use activities or allowing sufficient time for natural recovery to occur. These scenarios represent a misinterpretation of ecosystem needs, can exacerbate the degree of degradation, and can cause further difficulties in restoration. Restoration should be undertaken at the watershed or landscape scale. Riparian and stream ecosystems have largely been degraded by ecosystemwide, off-channel activities and, therefore, cannot be restored by focusing solely on manipulations within the channel. While ecological restoration comes at a high cost, it also is an investment in the natural capital of riparian and aquatic systems and the environmental wealth of the nation.},

Using hierarchical linear models, we examined the relations between flow regime and young-of-year fish density using fish sampling and discharge data from three different warmwater streams in Illinois, Alabama, and Georgia. We used an information theoretic approach to evaluate the relative support for models describing hypothesized influences of five flow regime components representing: short-term high and low flows; short-term flow stability; and long-term mean flows and flow stability on fish reproductive success during fish spawning and rearing periods. We also evaluated the influence of ten fish species traits on fish reproductive success. Species traits included spawning duration, reproductive strategy, egg incubation rate, swimming locomotion morphology, general habitat preference, and food habits. Model selection results indicated that young-of-year fish density was positively related to short-term high flows during the spawning period and negatively related to flow variability during the rearing period. However, the effect of the flow regime components varied substantially among species, but was related to species traits. The effect of short-term high flows on the reproductive success was lower for species that broadcast their eggs during spawning. Species with cruiser swimming locomotion morphologies (e.g., Micropterus) also were more vulnerable to variable flows during the rearing period. Our models provide insight into the conditions and timing of flows that influence the reproductive success of warmwater stream fishes and may guide decisions related to stream regulation and management.},

The different populations represent ecological types referred to as spring-, summer-, fall, and winter-run segments, as well as stream- and ocean-type, or stream- and ocean-maturing life history forms. However, they are more correctly described as a continuum of forms that fall along a temporal cline related to incubation and rearing temperatures that determine spawn timing and juvenile residence patterns. Population structure of chinook salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin, therefore, is the reflection of the genetic composition of the founding source or sources within the respective region, shaped by the environment, principally temperature, that defines life history evolutionary strategy to maximize fitness under the conditions delineated. The key in developing an effective recovery program for chinook salmon and steelhead is to recognize that measures taken must address the genetic and biological requirements of the population unit within the environmental template identified.},

	abstract = {Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, brown trout Salmo trutta (including the anadromous form, sea trout) and Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (including anadromous fish) provide important commercial and sports fisheries in Western Europe. As water temperature increases as a result of climate change, quantitative information on the thermal requirements of these three species is essential so that potential problems can be anticipated by those responsible for the conservation and sustainable management of the fisheries and the maintenance of biodiversity in freshwater ecosystems. Part I compares the temperature limits for survival, feeding and growth. Salmo salar has the highest temperature tolerance, followed by S. trutta and finally S. alpinus. For all three species, the temperature tolerance for alevins is slightly lower than that for parr and smolts, and the eggs have the lowest tolerance; this being the most vulnerable life stage to any temperature increase, especially for eggs of S. alpinus in shallow water. There was little evidence to support local thermal adaptation, except in very cold rivers (mean annual temperature {\textless} 6 center dot 5 degrees C). Part {II} illustrates the importance of developing predictive models, using data from a long-term study (1967-2000) of a juvenile anadromous S. trutta population. Individual-based models predicted the emergence period for the fry. Mean values over 34 years revealed a large variation in the timing of emergence with c. 2 months between extreme values. The emergence time correlated significantly with the North Atlantic Oscillation Index, indicating that interannual variations in emergence were linked to more general changes in climate. Mean stream temperatures increased significantly in winter and spring at a rate of 0 center dot 37 degrees C per decade, but not in summer and autumn, and led to an increase in the mean mass of pre-smolts. A growth model for S. trutta was validated by growth data from the long-term study and predicted growth under possible future conditions. Small increases ({\textless} 2 center dot 5 degrees C) in winter and spring would be beneficial for growth with 1 year-old smolts being more common. Water temperatures would have to increase by c. 4 degrees C in winter and spring, and 3 degrees C in summer and autumn before they had a marked negative effect on trout growth.},

	abstract = {North America harbors an astounding proportion of the world's freshwater species, but it is facing a freshwater biodiversity crisis. A first step to slowing the loss of biodiversity involves identifying gaps in existing efforts to conserve biodiversity and prioritizing opportunities to fill these gaps. In this monograph we detail two separate, but complementary, conservation planning efforts-a Gap Analysis ({GAP)} and a State Wildlife Action Plan ({WAP)-for} Missouri that address this first step. The goal of the Missouri Aquatic {GAP} Project was to identify riverine ecosystems, habitats, and species not adequately represented (i.e., gaps) within existing conservation lands. The goal of the freshwater component of the Missouri Wildlife Action Plan was to identify and map a set of conservation-opportunity areas ({COAs)} that holistically represent all riverine ecosystems, habitats, and species in Missouri. Since conservation planning is a geographical exercise, both efforts utilized geographic information systems ({GIS).} Four principal {GIS} data sets were used in each planning effort: (1) a hierarchical riverine ecosystem classification, (2) predicted species distributions, (3) public ownership/stewardship, and (4) a human-threat index. Results of the gap analyses are not encouraging. Forty five, mostly rare, threatened, or endangered, species are not represented in lands set aside for conserving biodiversity. Results also illustrate the fragmented nature of conservation lands, which are mainly situated in the uplands and fail to provide connectivity among riverine habitats. Furthermore, many conservation lands are severely threatened by an array of human disturbances. In contrast, results of the {WAP} provide hope that relatively intact riverine ecosystems still exist. A total of 158 {COAs}, representing similar to 6\% of the total kilometers of stream in Missouri, were selected for the {WAR} This illustrates that a wide spectrum of biodiversity can be represented within a small portion of the total resource base, but the area of conservation concern is often much larger. Identifying priority riverscapes for conservation is an important first step toward effective biodiversity conservation. Yet, achieving the ultimate goal of conserving biodiversity will require vigilance on the part of all responsible parties, with particular attention to addressing and coordinating the many remaining logistical tasks.},

We calculated insolation maps from digital elevation models, using an insolation model that accounts for atmospheric conditions, elevation, surface orientation, and influences of surrounding topography. Herein, we focus on the application of this insolation model for spatial interpolation of soil temperature measurements over complex topography at landscape scales. Existing interpolation techniques generally apply only at continental or broad regional scales and do not capture the high variation of finer scales. In our field study in the vicinity of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory, average soil temperature was correlated with insolation and elevation. Whereas daily minimum temperature was negatively correlated with elevation (r = -0.730, P {\textless} 0.05), daily temperature change (maximum minus minimum) was positively correlated with daily insolation (r = 0.504, P {\textless} 0.01). We generated daily minimum and maximum soil temperature maps based on regression analyses. Residual variation was explained by factors such as vegetation cover. This application demonstrates the importance of characterizing spatial and temporal variation of insolation for studies of energy and water balance. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science {B.V.}},

	volume = {60},
	issn = {0022-4561},
	abstract = {Forty-nine states are developing phosphorus (P) site indices to assess vulnerability of agricultural fields to P loss. When a P index has multiple variables and mathematical operations, it is often difficult to predict the sensitivity of the final site rating to individual input variables. Sensitivity analysis is a powerful diagnostic technique for assessing the behavior of a P index, prioritizing data collection and research efforts to improve its predictive capabilities, and for focusing management efforts. In this study, nominal range sensitivity analysis was used to determine the effect of input factor perturbations on the final P index score for agricultural biosolids recycling. Baseline conditions (P index score = 116) for the sensitivity analysis were established from a detailed evaluation of representative Pennsylvania sites targeted for biosolids application in 2003. The base condition was evaluated for Sensitivity Coefficient and Swing to identify the importance of individual input factors on final P index rating. For biosolids sites, P loss vulnerability forecast by the Pennsylvania P index was found to be relatively insensitive to subsurface drainage and mineral fertilizer application rate and method (with Swing values of 23, 18, and 4 respectively). Accordingly, uncertainty in these Low Impact P index variables will have little adverse effect on the reliability of index scores for biosolids land application. For sites receiving biosolids, the Pennsylvania P index is most sensitive to the biosotids application rate and method, organic P source coefficient, and nature of the site buffer strip. Remarkably, varying the P source coefficient (alone) over its full range of plausible input values resulted in a P index rating Swing of 167 points. Thus, beyond changing biosolids application rates and methods, the greatest potential to reduce the P index score is in establishing riparian buffer zones and reducing biosotids P source coefficients. It is important to note that the differential sensitivities of fertilizer P source rate and organic P source rate in the Pennsylvania index do not imply that organic P sources are inherently more susceptible to offsite P export than chemical fertilizers. Research efforts should focus on High-impact factors for improving the predictive capability of the P index.},

An allowable P application rate is specified based on the computed risk. This study focused on the Virginia P-Index. The objectives were to determine the factors to which the P-Index is most sensitive and to determine the factors to which the resulting P application rate recommendations are most sensitive. A differential analysis was used to calculate relative sensitivity for nine baseline scenarios: a low, medium, and high baseline within three different regions of Virginia. Impact of user variability in estimating factor values was evaluated using a probability distribution analysis. The P-Index was most sensitive in the low and medium baseline scenarios to P management factors, including annual application rate, method of fertilizer application, and source availability factor In high-risk baseline scenarios, the P-Index was most sensitive to transport factors (erosion, runoff, or leaching). User variability had a greater impact on the P-Index and on P application rate recommendations as P risk increased over each of the three regions. The closer afield's P-Index value is to a threshold between P recommendation rate categories, the higher the probability that alternate P application rates will be recommended due to user variability The results highlight the need for consistent estimation of factor values, particularly the factors to which the P-Index is most sensitive and particularly in the higher-risk situations.},

	abstract = {Diets of northern squawfish Ptychocheilus, smallmouth bass Micropterus dolomieu, walleye Stizostedion vitreum, and channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus from John Day Reservoir were examined to determine the extent of predation on juvenile salmonids during seaward migrations of the salmonids during April-August 1983-1986. Juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. and steelhead O. mykiss were the most important food group (by weight) of northern squawfish-about 67\%-but made up smaller proportions of the food of the other predators: channel catfish, 33\%; walleyes, 14\%; smallmouth bass, 4\%. Seasonal changes in diets indicated that northern squawfish preferred juvenile salmonids in May and August (generally the peak period of salmonid out-migration), and switched to prickly sculpin Cottus asper when numbers of juvenile salmonids declined; walleyes and smallmouth bass showed a preference only for prickly sculpin among the prey fishes analyzed. As judged by dietary composition and prey selectivity, the northern squawfish was the major fish predator on juvenile salmonids in the reservoir; channel catfish also were important predators in the upper reservoir in spring. Walleyes and smallmouth bass were much less important predators on salmonids, and appeared to select subyearling chinook salmon only in August when the distribution of this prey overlapped with that of the predators. Size-selective predation by northern squawfish may also play an important role in reducing survival of the smaller individuals within each run of out-migrating juvenile salmonids.},

	abstract = {One of the most common descriptors of the relationship between root and shoot biomass is the rootâ:âshoot ratio, which has become a core method for estimating root biomass from the more easily measured shoot biomass. Previous reviews have examined rootâ:âshoot ratio data, but have only considered particular vegetation types and have not always critically reviewed the data used. Reliable rootâ:âshoot ratios are needed for a wide range of vegetation types in order to improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates, including those required for estimating the effects of land management and land use change in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. This study reviewed rootâ:âshoot ratios in terrestrial biomes. A key facet of our analysis was a critical methodological review, through which unreliable data were identified and omitted on the basis of specific criteria. Of the 786 rootâ:âshoot ratio observations collated, 62\% were omitted because of inadequate or unverifiable root sampling methods. When only the reliable data were examined, rootâ:âshoot ratios were found to be negatively related to shoot biomass, mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, forest stand age, and forest stand height. Although a single allometric equation derived in this study reliably predicted root biomass from shoot biomass for forests and woodlands, in general, the use of vegetationâspecific rootâ:âshoot ratios were found to be a more accurate method for predicting root biomass. When the rootâ:âshoot ratio data collated here were applied to an analysis of the global carbon budget, there was a 50\% increase in estimated global root carbon stock, and a 12\% increase in estimated total carbon stock of terrestrial vegetation. The use of the vegetationâspecific rootâ:âshoot ratios presented in this study is likely to substantially improve the accuracy of root biomass estimates for purposes such as carbon accounting and for studies of ecosystem dynamics.},

In order for science to fulfill its potential in the arena of salmon recovery planning, several shortcomings of the science and its application to decision-making must be rectified. The definition of conservation units using genetic and phylogenetic inference needs to be sharpened. Ecological analyses must get beyond casting blame for past declines in salmon numbers and examine mixed strategies of management that consider interactions between hatcheries, harvest, hydropower, and habitat factors as well as background natural stresses and invasive species. Glib acceptance of expert opinion and extrapolated or inferred data should be tempered. To deal with uncertainty, recovery teams should engage in scenario analyses in which a wide variety of assumptions are played out. Finally, there is a pressing need for analyses aimed at determining what circumstances and communication strategies give science an effective voice in decision-making.},

Water turbidity affects water temperature, as suspended particles in a water column absorb and scatter sunlight and hence determine the extinction of solar radiation. To get a better understanding of the relationship between water turbidity and water temperature, a series of semi-natural larval habitats (diameter 0.32 m, water depth 0.16 m) with increasing water turbidity was created. Here we show that at midday (1300 hours) the upper water layer (thickness of 10 mm) of the water pool with the highest turbidity was on average 2.8 degrees C warmer than the same layer of the clearest water pool. Suspended soil particles increase the water temperature and furthermore change the temperature dynamics of small water collections during daytime, exposing malaria mosquito larvae, which live in the top water layer, longer to higher temperatures.},

To assess potential climate warming effects on stream fishes, predictive models were developed for 50 common fish species using classification-tree analysis of 69 environmental variables in a geographic information system. Model accuracy was 56 center dot 0-93 center dot 5\% in validation tests. Models were applied to all 86 898 km of stream in the state under four different climate scenarios: current conditions, limited climate warming (summer air temperatures increase 1 degrees C and water 0 center dot 8 degrees C), moderate warming (air 3 degrees C and water 2 center dot 4 degrees C) and major warming (air 5 degrees C and water 4 degrees C). With climate warming, 23 fishes were predicted to decline in distribution (three to extirpation under the major warming scenario), 23 to increase and four to have no change. Overall, declining species lost substantially more stream length than increasing species gained. All three cold-water and 16 cool-water fishes and four of 31 warm-water fishes were predicted to decline, four warm-water fishes to remain the same and 23 warm-water fishes to increase in distribution. Species changes were predicted to be most dramatic in small streams in northern Wisconsin that currently have cold to cool summer water temperatures and are dominated by cold-water and cool-water fishes, and least in larger and warmer streams and rivers in southern Wisconsin that are currently dominated by warm-water fishes. Results of this study suggest that even small increases in summer air and water temperatures owing to climate warming will have major effects on the distribution of stream fishes in Wisconsin.},

Flashiness is an important component of a stream's hydrologic regime. A variety of land use and land management changes may lead to increased or decreased flashiness, often to the detriment of aquatic life. This paper presents a newly developed flashiness index, which is based on mean daily flows. The index is calculated by dividing the pathlength of flow oscillations for a time interval (i.e., the sum of the absolute values of day-to-day changes in mean daily flow) by total discharge during that time interval. This index has low interannual variability, relative to most flow regime indicators, and thus greater power to detect trends. Index values were calculated for 515 Midwestern streams for the 27-year period from 1975 through 2001. Statistically significant increases were present in 22 percent of the streams, primarily in the eastern portion of the study area, while decreases were present in 9 percent, primarily in the western portion. Index values tend to decrease with increasing watershed area and with increasing unit area ground water inputs. Area compensated index values often shift at ecoregion boundaries. Potential index applications include evaluation of programs to restore more natural flow regimes.},

On the basis of predicted changes to air pressure and an empirical relationship between wind-driven upwelling and zooplankton biomass, we calculate that production of food for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) may decrease by 5-9\%. We developed empirical relationships between sea surface temperature, zooplankton biomass, adult recruitment, and terminal ocean weight for the early Stuart stock of Fraser River sockeye salmon. Our analyses show that warmer sea surface temperatures, larger adult recruitment, and lower zooplankton biomass are correlated with smaller adult sockeye. Bioenergetics modeling suggests that higher metabolic costs in warmer water coupled with lower food availability could cause the observed reductions in size. Warmer sea surface temperatures during coastal migration by juveniles were correlated with lower recruitment 2 yr later. Warmer sea surface temperatures may be a surrogate for increased levels of predation or decreased food during the juvenile stage. We speculate that Fraser sockeye will be less abundant and smaller if the climate changes as suggested by the Canadian Climate Centre's general circulation model.},

	abstract = {Widespread declines among Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and brown trout (Salmo trutta) over recent decades have been linked to pollution, exploitation and catchment modification, but climate change is increasingly implicated. We used long-term, geographically extensive data from the Welsh River Wye, formerly a major salmon river, to examine whether climatically mediated effects on juveniles ({\textgreater} 0+) might contribute to population change. Populations of Atlantic salmon and brown trout fell across the Wye catchment, respectively, by 50\% and 67\% between 1985 and 2004, but could not be explained by pollution because water quality improved during this time. Stream temperatures, estimated from calibrations against weekly air temperature at eight sites, increased by 0.5-0.7 degrees C in summer and 0.7-1.0 degrees C in winter, with larger tributaries warming more than shaded headwaters. Rates of winter warming were slightly greater after accounting for the effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation (1.1-1.4 degrees C). However, warming through time was smaller than measured variations among tributaries, and alone was insufficient to explain variations in salmonid density. Instead, population variations were best explained in multilevel mixed models by a synoptic variate representing a trend towards hotter, drier summers, implying interactions between climate warming, varying discharge and fluctuations in both brown trout and salmon. Taken alongside recent data showing effects of warming on survival at sea, these data suggest that Atlantic salmon might be jeopardized by future climatic effects in both their marine and freshwater stages. Effects on nondiadromous brown trout also imply climatically mediated processes in freshwaters or their catchments. Climate projections for the United Kingdom suggest that altered summer flow and increasing summer temperatures could exacerbate losses further in these species, and we advocate management actions that combine reduced abstraction with enhanced riparian shading.},

Here we analyze the rich, pan-tropical database of classified Landsat scenes created by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations to examine pathways of agricultural expansion across the major tropical forest regions in the 1980s and 1990s and use this information to highlight the future land conversions that probably will be needed to meet mounting demand for agricultural products. Across the tropics, we find that between 1980 and 2000 more than 55\% of new agricultural land came at the expense of intact forests, and another 28\% came from disturbed forests.

Although both method-yield similar slope values, the use of the manual method leads to an underestimation of the erosion risk because the effect of flow convergence is not accounted for. The computer procedure has the obvious advantage that it can easily be linked to {GIS} software. If data on land use and soils are available, specific K, C and P-values can be assigned to each land unit so that predicted soil losses can then be calculated using a simple overlay procedure. The algorithm leaves the user the choice to consider land units as being hydrologically isolated or continuous.

	abstract = {{SUMMARY1.}Â The prediction of species distributions is of primary importance in ecology and conservation biology. Statistical models play an important role in this regard; however, researchers have little guidance when choosing between competing methodologies because few comparative studies have been conducted. 2.Â We provide a comprehensive comparison of traditional and alternative techniques for predicting species distributions using logistic regression analysis, linear discriminant analysis, classification trees and artificial neural networks to model: (1) the presence/absence of 27 fish species as a function of habitat conditions in 286 temperate lakes located in south-central Ontario, Canada and (2) simulated data sets exhibiting deterministic, linear and non-linear species response curves. 3.Â Detailed evaluation of model predictive power showed that approaches produced species models that differed in overall correct classification, specificity (i.e. ability to correctly predict species absence) and sensitivity (i.e. ability to correctly predict speciespresence) and in terms of which of the study lakes they correctly classified. Onaverage, neural networks outperformed the other modelling approaches, although all approaches predicted species presence/absence with moderate to excellent success. 4.Â Based on simulated non-linear data, classification trees and neural networks greatly outperformed traditional approaches, whereas all approaches exhibited similar correct classification rates when modelling simulated linear data. 5.Â Detailed evaluation of model explanatory insight showed that the relative importance of the habitat variables in the species models varied among the approaches, where habitat variable importance was similar among approaches for some species and very different for others. 6.Â In general, differences in predictive power (both correct classification rate and identity of the lakes correctly classified) among the approaches corresponded with differences in habitat variable importance, suggesting that non-linear modelling approaches (i.e. classification trees and neural networks) are better able to capture and model complex, non-linear patterns found in ecological data. The results from the comparisons using simulated data further support this notion. 7.Â By employing parallel modelling approaches with the same set of data and focusing on comparing multiple metrics of predictive performance, researchers can begin to choose predictive models that not only provide the greatest predictive power, but also best fit the proposed application.},
