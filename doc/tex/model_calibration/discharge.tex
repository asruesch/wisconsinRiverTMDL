\subsection{Discharge}
Observed data for discharge were obtained from USGS in late September.

\subsubsection{Iterative calibration notes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Calibrated monthly flows by allowing basin snow parameters to vary across their full range. Iterated 2000 times. Used PBIAS to select best fit. Resulting snowfall temperature parameter initially was fit to an unrealistic value of -10 degrees C.
\end{itemize}
